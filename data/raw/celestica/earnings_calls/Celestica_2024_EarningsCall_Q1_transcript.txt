[02:26.1 - 02:30.8] Unless otherwise specified, all references to dollars on this call are to U.S. dollars
[02:30.8 - 02:35.2] and per share information is based on diluted shares outstanding.
[02:35.2 - 02:38.4] Let me now turn the call over to Rob.
[02:38.4 - 02:42.8] Thank you, Craig, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call.
[02:42.8 - 02:49.0] We started off the year with a very strong first quarter, achieving revenue of $2.21
[02:49.1 - 02:55.9] million, while our adjusted EPS came in at 86 cents, both exceeding the high end of our guidance
[02:55.9 - 03:03.4] ranges. Our non-IFRS operating margin was 6.2 percent, which was above the midpoint of our
[03:03.4 - 03:10.7] revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges. Our solid non-IFRS operating margins resulted in
[03:10.7 - 03:16.9] adjusted pre-cash flow of $65 million during the quarter. The strong performance to kick off the
[03:16.9 - 03:22.6] year was driven by the ongoing strength in our TCS segment, supported by continued demand
[03:22.6 - 03:28.3] strength from a hyperscale of customers. This dynamic drove solid sequential and year-to-year
[03:28.3 - 03:35.0] growth in revenues across both our enterprise and communications and markets and resulted in
[03:35.0 - 03:43.8] CCS segment margin of 7 percent, 120 basis point improvement year-over-year. In our ACS segment,
[03:43.8 - 03:49.7] revenues were down slightly year-to-year, as anticipated, driven primarily by demand softness
[03:49.7 - 03:55.6] from customers in our industrial business, partially offset by growth across our other
[03:55.6 - 04:03.1] ATS businesses. Our A&D business continues to see solid double-digit year-to-year revenue growth,
[04:03.1 - 04:08.4] and the outlook for the year remains positive. And after several tough quarters in our capital
[04:08.4 - 04:13.4] equipment business, revenues appear to have stabilized and customer forecasts
[04:13.9 - 04:18.0] are signaling that year-to-year growth will accelerate in the coming quarters.
[04:20.3 - 04:24.3] We are also pleased to share an update regarding a recent token acquisition.
[04:25.5 - 04:29.6] Following the close of the quarter, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire
[04:29.6 - 04:36.5] NCS Global Services LLC, a U.S.-based IT infrastructure and asset management business
[04:36.5 - 04:43.8] for $36 million. This acquisition accelerates our IT services roadmap within our CCS segment
[04:44.4 - 04:49.4] by expanding our strategic capabilities and geographic footprint, and allowing us to
[04:49.4 - 04:54.4] enhance our service offerings across the entire lifecycle of our customers' assets.
[04:55.2 - 05:00.0] This acquisition is strongly aligned to our strategic roadmaps and meets our financial
[05:00.0 - 05:07.4] hurdles, including being accretive to our adjusted EPF in 2024. Overall, we are very
[05:07.4 - 05:12.6] pleased with our start to the year. We are encouraged by our solid execution, our strong
[05:12.6 - 05:17.8] financial performance, and by the positive market tailwinds across a number of the businesses in our
[05:17.8 - 05:23.8] portfolio. I would now like to turn the call over to Mandeep, who will provide further details on
[05:23.8 - 05:28.6] our first quarter financial performance and our guidance for the second quarter of 2024.
[05:29.4 - 05:33.4] Mandeep, over to you. Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone.
[05:34.2 - 05:39.8] First quarter revenue came in at $2.21 billion, above the high end of our guidance range,
[05:39.8 - 05:45.1] and up 20% year-over-year. The increase was supported by stronger-than-expected growth in
[05:45.1 - 05:52.2] our CCS segment, partially offset by an anticipated modest decline in our ATS segment. Our first
[05:52.2 - 05:59.0] quarter non-IFRS operating margin of 6.2% was an improvement of 100 basis points year-over-year,
[05:59.7 - 06:05.3] and marked the first time that our quarterly non-IFRS operating margin exceeded 6.0%.
[06:07.0 - 06:10.8] The margin expansion was driven by improved profitability in both segments
[06:10.8 - 06:14.4] as a result of favorable mix and production efficiency.
[06:16.2 - 06:20.2] Our adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter was 86 cents,
[06:20.2 - 06:26.1] which exceeded the high end of our guidance range. Our adjusted EPS was up 39 cents compared
[06:26.1 - 06:32.0] to the prior year period, driven primarily by higher non-IFRS operating earnings and a more
[06:32.0 - 06:38.5] favorable adjusted effective tax rate. Our first quarter adjusted effective tax rate expectation
[06:38.5 - 06:45.5] was 20%, assuming that global minimum tax would be enacted in Canada by March 31st. Given the
[06:45.5 - 06:50.9] legislation has not yet been enacted, our adjusted effective tax rate came in favorably
[06:50.9 - 06:55.4] at 15%, leading to a benefit of approximately 5 cents per share.
[06:57.3 - 07:03.3] Moving on to our segment performance. ATS revenue in the first quarter was $768 million,
[07:04.1 - 07:09.9] down 3% year-over-year, which was in line with our expectations of a low single-digit percentage
[07:09.9 - 07:16.1] decrease. The year-over-year decline in ATS segment revenue was driven by continued demand
[07:16.1 - 07:22.2] softness in our industrial business. These declines were partially offset by solid year-to-year growth
[07:22.2 - 07:28.2] in our A&E business. In addition, our capital equipment business saw revenues stabilize on
[07:28.2 - 07:32.7] a year-to-year basis, registering modest growth compared to the prior year period.
[07:33.8 - 07:38.8] ATS segment revenue accounted for 35% of total revenues in the first quarter.
[07:40.6 - 07:48.1] Our first quarter CCS segment revenue of $1.44 billion was 38% higher compared to the prior
[07:48.1 - 07:53.7] year period, driven by strong growth in both our enterprise and communications end market.
[07:54.6 - 07:59.5] CCS segment revenue accounted for 65% of total company revenues in the quarter.
[08:01.3 - 08:06.6] Revenue in our enterprise end market was up by 72% year-over-year in the first quarter,
[08:07.3 - 08:13.4] exceeding our expectation of a high 60% increase. The growth was driven by continued
[08:13.4 - 08:17.8] demand strength for AIML compute products from our hyperscaler customers.
[08:19.8 - 08:25.5] Revenue in our communications end market was higher by 17% compared to the prior year quarter,
[08:25.5 - 08:29.6] which was better than our expectation of a low single-digit percentage increase.
[08:30.4 - 08:35.7] The return to growth in our communications end market was driven by increased demand for HPS
[08:35.7 - 08:42.2] networking products from hyperscaler customers, predominantly in support of AIML infrastructure.
[08:44.0 - 08:52.2] HPS revenue was $519 million in the quarter, up 40% year-over-year, and accounted for 23%
[08:52.2 - 08:57.5] of total company revenues in the quarter. Growth in the first quarter was driven primarily by
[08:57.5 - 09:02.2] stronger networking demand from hyperscaler customers, including new program ramps.
[09:02.5 - 09:07.8] Turning to segment margins, ATS segment margin in the first quarter was 4.7%,
[09:08.5 - 09:13.2] up 30 basis points compared to the prior year period, driven by favorable mix.
[09:14.8 - 09:22.1] CCS segment margin during the quarter was 7.0%, up 120 basis points year-over-year,
[09:22.1 - 09:27.2] as a result of improved mix and volume leverage, which drove strong productivity.
[09:27.3 - 09:32.5] During the first quarter, we had one customer that accounted for more than 10% of total revenues,
[09:32.5 - 09:38.2] representing 34% of sales for the quarter. We continue to support this strong demand
[09:38.2 - 09:43.8] with solid execution across a number of programs, and we remain comfortable with our current levels
[09:43.8 - 09:46.6] of concentration with this customer in our portfolio.
[09:48.6 - 09:53.6] Moving on to some additional financial metrics. IFRS net earnings for the first quarter were
[09:53.6 - 10:01.4] $102 million, or $0.85 per share, compared to $25 million, or $0.20 per share, in the prior year
[10:01.4 - 10:09.0] period. Adjusted gross margin for the first quarter was 10.2%, up 80 basis points year-over-year,
[10:09.6 - 10:14.0] due to more favorable mix and production efficiencies resulting from higher volumes.
[10:15.7 - 10:22.9] Our adjusted ROIC for the first quarter was 24.8%, up 10.2% year-over-year,
[10:22.9 - 10:30.8] or 24.8%, an improvement of 6.9% compared to the prior year quarter, driven by higher profitability
[10:30.8 - 10:36.6] and effective working capital management. Moving on to working capital. At the end of
[10:36.6 - 10:44.1] the first quarter, our inventory balance was $1.96 billion, down $150 million sequentially,
[10:44.1 - 10:51.5] and down $440 million year-over-year. Cash deposits were $719 million at the end of the
[10:51.5 - 10:58.2] first quarter, $185 million lower sequentially, and down by $91 million compared to the prior
[10:58.2 - 11:04.6] year period. Our cash deposits decreased, as expected, as a result of higher deliveries
[11:04.6 - 11:11.0] on a number of ramping projects. Cash cycle days were 69 during the first quarter,
[11:11.0 - 11:15.4] down three days sequentially, and six days lower than the prior year period.
[11:15.4 - 11:21.0] Moving on to cash flows. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $40 million, or approximately
[11:21.0 - 11:27.1] 1.8% of revenue, flat compared with the prior year period. Consistent with our discussion
[11:27.1 - 11:35.3] last quarter, we continue to expect our capital expenditures for 2024 to be between 1.75% and 2.25%
[11:35.3 - 11:42.9] of revenues. During the first quarter, we commenced operations at two of our new facility expansions,
[11:42.9 - 11:49.0] the first phase addition to our Thailand facility, and the 80,000-square-foot expansion at our Kulim
[11:49.0 - 11:55.2] site in Malaysia. We remain on track to complete the second phase of our Thailand facility expansion
[11:55.2 - 12:00.7] by the first half of 2025, which will add more than 100,000 square feet of manufacturing floor
[12:00.7 - 12:08.2] space to support our programs with hyperscaler customers. Turning to our adjusted free cash flow,
[12:08.2 - 12:15.8] we generated $65 million in the first quarter, compared to $9 million in the prior year period.
[12:17.8 - 12:23.5] Moving on to some additional key metrics. At the end of the first quarter, our cash balance was
[12:23.5 - 12:30.8] $308 million. In combination with our approximately $600 million in borrowing capacity under our
[12:30.8 - 12:36.8] revolver, this provides us with liquidity of approximately $900 million, which we believe
[12:36.8 - 12:44.3] is sufficient to meet our anticipated business needs. Our gross debt at the end of the first
[12:44.3 - 12:53.4] quarter was $632 million, leaving us with a net debt position of $324 million. Our first quarter
[12:53.4 - 13:01.9] gross debt to non-IFRS trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 1.0 turns, down 0.1
[13:01.9 - 13:07.4] turns sequentially, and down 0.3 turns compared to the same period last year.
[13:09.5 - 13:15.8] As of March 31st, 2024, we were compliant with all financial covenants under our credit agreement.
[13:17.6 - 13:23.0] During the first quarter, we purchased approximately 460,000 shares for cancellation
[13:23.0 - 13:30.6] under our normal course issuer bid at a cost of $17 million. We intend to continue to repurchase
[13:30.6 - 13:37.4] shares on an opportunistic basis in 2024. Now turning to our guidance for the second quarter
[13:37.4 - 13:44.5] of 2024. Revenues in the second quarter are expected to be in the range of $2.175 billion
[13:44.5 - 13:50.5] to $2.325 billion, which, if the midpoint of this range is achieved,
[13:50.5 - 13:57.3] would represent growth of 16% compared to the prior year period. Second quarter adjusted
[13:57.3 - 14:04.3] earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.75 to $0.85, which, at the midpoint,
[14:04.3 - 14:11.7] would represent an improvement of $0.25 per share, or 45% compared to the second quarter of 2023.
[14:13.0 - 14:17.8] If the midpoint of our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges are achieved,
[14:17.8 - 14:24.5] non-IFRS operating margin would be 6.1%, which would represent an increase of 60 basis points
[14:24.5 - 14:30.8] over the same period last year. Our adjusted SG&A expense for the second quarter is expected
[14:30.8 - 14:38.5] to be in the range of $67 to $69 million. We anticipate our adjusted effective tax rate
[14:38.5 - 14:44.8] to be approximately 20% for the second quarter, excluding any impact from taxable foreign exchange
[14:44.8 - 14:51.5] or unanticipated tax settlements. Consistent with our approach last quarter, our guidance assumed
[14:51.5 - 14:58.8] that our income will be subject to global minimum tax. Now turning to our end market outlook for the
[14:58.8 - 15:05.4] second quarter of 2024. In our ATS segment, we anticipate revenue to be down in the high
[15:05.4 - 15:11.1] single-digit percentage range year-over-year, driven by demand softness in our industrial business,
[15:11.1 - 15:17.5] partly offset by growth in A&D and capital equipment. We anticipate revenues in our
[15:17.5 - 15:23.4] communications end market to be up in the mid-40 percentage range year-over-year, driven by
[15:23.4 - 15:30.5] strengthening demand for HPS networking products from hyperscaler customers. Finally, in our
[15:30.5 - 15:36.5] enterprise end market, we expect revenue to be up in the low 20 percentage range year-over-year,
[15:36.5 - 15:42.6] driven by anticipated demand growth in AI and ML compute programs from our hyperscaler customers.
[15:42.8 - 15:47.2] I'll now turn the call back over to Rob to discuss the outlook for each of our end markets
[15:47.2 - 15:55.2] and the overall business. Thank you, Mandeep. Before discussing the outlook for our end markets,
[15:55.2 - 15:59.6] I would like to provide an update to our annual financial outlook for 2024.
[16:00.7 - 16:05.7] We are pleased to be raising our full-year outlook based on our solid performance in the first quarter
[16:05.7 - 16:09.5] and the positive momentum we are seeing across a number of our businesses.
[16:10.0 - 16:17.2] We now expect revenue of $9.1 billion in 2024 and adjusted EPS of $3.30,
[16:18.2 - 16:25.6] which would represent a growth of 14% and 36%, respectively, compared to 2023.
[16:27.4 - 16:35.0] A non-IFRS operating margin is now expected to be approximately 6.1%, which would represent
[16:35.4 - 16:41.8] a 50-basis point improvement compared to 2023. Finally, we are raising our adjusted
[16:41.8 - 16:49.1] pre-cash flow outlook to $250 million for the full year. Now, moving on to the outlook for our
[16:49.1 - 16:58.0] businesses. Beginning with our ATS segment, within ATS, we continue to anticipate a decline in the
[16:58.1 - 17:06.3] We continue to anticipate a decline in the first half of 2024 compared to 2023 and for year-to-year
[17:06.3 - 17:12.2] growth to resume in the back half of the year. As a result, we are now expecting ATS segment
[17:12.2 - 17:18.0] revenues to be approximately flat for the full year in 2024 compared to 2023.
[17:19.7 - 17:24.8] In our industrial business, we believe that key sub-markets, including EV charging,
[17:24.8 - 17:31.6] smart energy, on-vehicle, and factory automation will continue to be supported by favorable secular
[17:31.6 - 17:37.0] trends in our economy over the long term and will help drive robust and sustainable growth
[17:37.0 - 17:43.7] in our industrial business in the coming years. However, in the near term, the industrial business
[17:43.7 - 17:49.7] continues to experience softness across a number of our sub-markets, given in large part by EV
[17:49.7 - 17:56.3] charging, as the industry works through an inventory backlog amidst a slowdown in demand
[17:56.3 - 18:03.4] for electric vehicles. However, we do expect demand to improve as the year progresses and for
[18:03.4 - 18:10.1] revenues to show sequential improvement throughout 2024, with a return to year-to-year growth expected
[18:10.1 - 18:17.0] by the fourth quarter. In our A&D business, the recovery in air traffic continues to drive solid
[18:17.0 - 18:22.4] commercial aerospace growth. We expect broad-based demand strength in our commercial aerospace
[18:22.4 - 18:31.0] portfolio to persist throughout 2024. We also anticipate healthy growth in our defense business
[18:31.0 - 18:34.7] this year, supported by the ramping of new programs.
[18:38.1 - 18:42.5] In our capital equipment business, we are seeing early signs of a recovery,
[18:43.0 - 18:47.8] with revenues stabilizing both year-to-year and sequentially in the first quarter.
[18:49.0 - 18:54.6] The latest third-party forecasts are now calling for an improved demand outlook for the wafer fab
[18:54.6 - 19:02.4] equipment market in 2024, supported primarily by a recovery in the memory market. Within our
[19:02.4 - 19:08.8] portfolio, stronger base demand and the ramping of newly won programs are affirming our outlook
[19:08.8 - 19:16.5] for return to growth in 2024. Market forecasts currently suggest that capital investments by
[19:16.5 - 19:23.4] chip manufacturers will continue to grow into 2025 in order to support demand for processes
[19:23.4 - 19:29.7] used in generative AI applications and increase silicon content in products within other sectors,
[19:29.7 - 19:35.6] such as automotives. We anticipate that these trends will support continued momentum
[19:35.6 - 19:44.0] in our portfolio into next year. Now turning to our CCS segment. Based on the strong outlook in
[19:44.0 - 19:49.7] our CCS segment, we are raising our expectation for revenue growth to the mid-20s percentage range
[19:49.7 - 19:57.5] for 2024, supported by solid demand in both our enterprise and communications and markets.
[19:57.5 - 20:03.4] The demand strength from our hyperscaler customers continues to support very strong growth in our
[20:03.4 - 20:11.4] CCS segment. In 2023, hyperscalers accounted for 62 percent of our CCS segment revenues,
[20:12.0 - 20:19.8] and we expect that number to grow in 2024. As we have discussed in recent quarters and at our
[20:19.8 - 20:26.1] November 2023 investor day, the growth in demand for new AI and machine learning applications
[20:26.1 - 20:32.6] remains the primary driver underpinning this investment cycle. We continue to believe that
[20:32.6 - 20:38.7] this secular scheme is durable in its nature and is likely to support continued demand strength for
[20:38.7 - 20:46.5] our CCS offerings into 2025. As such, we are continuing to make the necessary investments,
[20:47.0 - 20:52.6] including in capacity expansion and engineering capabilities, in order to maintain our position
[20:52.6 - 20:59.6] as a leading provider of critical products and services for the data center. Now moving on to our
[20:59.6 - 21:07.9] end markets. The demand outlook for our enterprise end markets remains very healthy as we continue to
[21:07.9 - 21:14.4] benefit from the growing investment in AI ML compute capacity by hyperscalers. We anticipate
[21:14.4 - 21:20.1] enterprise demand to remain strong in the coming quarters, supported by increasing AI ML compute
[21:20.1 - 21:27.0] deployments and new program ramps. Our communications and markets are stronger than anticipated demand
[21:27.0 - 21:33.3] to start the year, and we expect this momentum to accelerate in the coming quarters. We anticipate
[21:33.3 - 21:39.0] sustained growth throughout 2024, supported by strong demand from hyperscaler customers for
[21:39.0 - 21:46.8] HPS networking products and the ramping of new programs. Within our HPS business, the demand
[21:46.8 - 21:52.4] largely mirrors that of our communications end market. Our outlet calls for sustained double
[21:52.4 - 21:58.6] digit growth throughout 2024, supported by increased deployment of networking infrastructure
[21:58.6 - 22:05.4] from hyperscalers after a period of inventory digestion in 2023. In addition, new program
[22:05.4 - 22:12.2] wins, including for our 800G platforms, are expected to ramp throughout the year and into 2025.
[22:14.2 - 22:19.7] We feel that our portfolio is well positioned for another very strong year in 2024.
[22:20.6 - 22:25.4] We continue to prioritize the fundamentals, adherence to our strategic roadmaps,
[22:26.0 - 22:32.5] solid execution, and prudent decision-making in all of our businesses, regardless of the dynamics
[22:32.5 - 22:38.9] at play within the underlying markets. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our
[22:38.9 - 22:43.5] financial targets and continue generating long-term values for our shareholders.
[22:44.6 - 22:48.3] With that, I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for questions.
[22:49.3 - 22:49.8] Thank you.
[22:52.6 - 22:57.4] Thank you, presenters. And ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question and answer session.
[22:57.4 - 23:01.8] Should you have a question, please press the star followed by the number one on your touchtone
[23:01.8 - 23:06.8] phone. You will hear a prompt that your hand has been raised. And should you wish to decline from
[23:06.8 - 23:11.9] the polling process, please press the star followed by the number two. If you're using
[23:11.9 - 23:16.5] a speakerphone, please lift the handset before pressing any keys. And one moment, please,
[23:16.5 - 23:25.7] for your first question. Your first question comes from the line of Robert Young of Canaccord
[23:25.7 - 23:30.3] University. Your line is now open. Hi, good morning. Congrats on the quarter.
[23:30.9 - 23:36.8] The first question I had was related to the full-year guide. It would just simply take the
[23:36.8 - 23:43.2] Q1 and Q2 guide out of there. It implies a deceleration in the top line in the second half.
[23:43.2 - 23:47.3] And so, I'm just curious if that's visibility into the second half or is there something
[23:48.2 - 23:55.8] specific to call out there or any other factor? Yeah, good morning, Rob. And thank you. So,
[23:55.8 - 24:03.5] hyperscaler demand remains healthy across multiple markets and demand signals remain healthy,
[24:03.5 - 24:08.2] but really it comes down to visibility and you touched on it. So, hyperscaler customers generally
[24:08.2 - 24:14.3] provide about a 12-month outlook, but beyond six months, there are some demand dynamics at play.
[24:15.2 - 24:20.4] You know, demand continues to exceed supply. So, as material availability improves,
[24:20.4 - 24:26.3] orders accelerate. And then secondarily, there is some variability in customer deployment plans,
[24:26.3 - 24:31.8] you know, driven by customers' resource constraints or to some extent technology transitions.
[24:32.5 - 24:39.1] So, our visibility into the fourth quarter is a bit murky. It should firm up in the next few
[24:39.1 - 24:45.7] months, but hence our view of, you know, a flattish relative to the first half
[24:47.4 - 24:53.0] full-year outlook. Yeah. Hey, Rob. Mandeep here. Just to build on what Rob was mentioning,
[24:53.0 - 24:59.4] you know, the 9100 reflects 14% year-over-year growth. And to your point, the second half
[24:59.4 - 25:04.0] year-over-year is a little bit lower than the first half, but still a strong double-digit
[25:04.7 - 25:10.6] set of numbers. I think the important thing to take away is that the demand environment in CCS
[25:10.6 - 25:18.2] in particular remains healthy. We're not seeing areas of concern, but we are being mindful of
[25:18.2 - 25:22.5] things such as material availability and going back to our customers and saying, look, Q2 came
[25:22.5 - 25:26.4] in stronger than what we had thought it was going to be. What are the implications for the back half
[25:26.4 - 25:31.1] of the year? And so, those discussions are continuing. Okay. Thanks. That's very helpful.
[25:31.8 - 25:37.1] Second question for me would be on the customer concentration. I think last quarter you suggested
[25:37.1 - 25:43.6] that networking recovery would maybe help that out a little bit. And so, you know, with HPS
[25:43.6 - 25:49.0] returning to growth, I was surprised to see the concentration actually go up. And so, is that,
[25:49.0 - 25:55.4] you know, networking plus AI at that first – that largest customer, or is there any other dynamic
[25:55.4 - 26:01.4] at play? And then I'll pass the line. Yeah. You hit on it, Rob, which is 34% with our biggest
[26:01.4 - 26:06.2] customer. At the same time, we saw a very large level of growth happening in comms and it's
[26:06.2 - 26:11.2] continuing to the second quarter. And it just underscores what we had talked about last quarter,
[26:11.2 - 26:16.6] which is we do a number of programs, 20-plus programs with this largest customer. And so,
[26:16.6 - 26:20.5] not only are we seeing demand strength on the compute side with that large customer,
[26:20.5 - 26:24.5] but we're also seeing an acceleration now on the switching side as well. And so,
[26:24.5 - 26:27.8] we're happy that our portfolio is able to support them in multiple areas.
[26:29.1 - 26:33.3] And I'll add that beyond the top customer growth remains
[26:34.0 - 26:36.0] very healthy across a number of our hyperscalers.
[26:36.0 - 26:38.8] customers as well along those same platforms,
[26:38.8 - 26:40.3] the comms enterprise.
[26:41.1 - 26:42.4] And just as a follow on there,
[26:42.4 - 26:47.4] the HPS growth I assume is driven by 400 gig switch.
[26:48.2 - 26:51.7] Now, is that spread across a large number of customers?
[26:51.7 - 26:55.5] Is it broader than just that large customer?
[26:55.5 - 26:57.2] Maybe give us a sense of, you know,
[26:57.2 - 26:58.6] how many customers you have there
[26:58.6 - 27:00.3] or how broad that business is.
[27:01.7 - 27:04.9] Yeah, 400 gig is across a number of customers.
[27:04.9 - 27:08.4] We're also ramping 800 gig switches this year
[27:08.4 - 27:10.1] and into next year.
[27:10.1 - 27:12.5] Next year, additional customers will come on
[27:12.5 - 27:15.9] on 800 gig switch ramps.
[27:15.9 - 27:19.7] And then on HPS, it's also important to point out
[27:19.7 - 27:23.3] that HPS is not just limited to networking.
[27:23.3 - 27:25.7] There's also a fair amount of HPS content
[27:25.7 - 27:27.8] in compute modules these days as well.
[27:29.1 - 27:30.0] Okay, thanks.
[27:30.0 - 27:30.8] I'll pass the line.
[27:32.6 - 27:33.7] Thank you so much.
[27:34.6 - 27:36.4] And your next question comes from the line
[27:36.4 - 27:38.8] of Daniel Chan of TD Common.
[27:38.8 - 27:39.6] Please go ahead.
[27:41.0 - 27:41.8] Hi, good morning.
[27:41.8 - 27:45.0] And maybe just to top up on that communications question,
[27:46.1 - 27:48.8] as you get more mix of 800G,
[27:48.8 - 27:50.2] how does that affect the financials?
[27:50.2 - 27:52.1] In other words, what is the price and margin profile
[27:52.1 - 27:55.5] difference between an 800G and a 400G program?
[27:57.9 - 27:58.8] Hi, Dan.
[27:58.8 - 27:59.6] Thanks for the question.
[27:59.6 - 28:02.6] So the AFPs of course change a little bit
[28:02.6 - 28:05.6] as you go from 400G to 800G,
[28:05.6 - 28:08.0] but not necessarily twice as much.
[28:08.0 - 28:09.1] And so it's really a conversation
[28:09.1 - 28:11.8] of how many units are being shipped, et cetera.
[28:11.8 - 28:13.4] I think if we were to just up-level it
[28:13.4 - 28:15.4] and look at overall revenue,
[28:15.4 - 28:20.1] we expect revenue growth to be higher year-over-year
[28:20.1 - 28:22.4] as the 800G deployments happen.
[28:22.4 - 28:24.3] To the question that you're asking,
[28:24.3 - 28:26.7] 400G demand is really, as you know,
[28:26.7 - 28:29.9] communications slow down because of an inventory overbill.
[28:29.9 - 28:32.8] We're now seeing customers not only work with us
[28:32.8 - 28:35.4] on program development around 800G products,
[28:35.4 - 28:38.4] but also taking 400G products in the meantime as well.
[28:38.4 - 28:39.9] And so it's nice to see that
[28:39.9 - 28:42.2] we're actually shipping both products right now.
[28:42.2 - 28:44.2] We would expect naturally for 400G
[28:44.2 - 28:46.8] to start slowing down going into next year.
[28:46.8 - 28:50.0] That's still more than a one-for-one on the 800G side.
[28:52.9 - 28:54.1] Thanks, that's helpful.
[28:54.1 - 28:57.2] When you talk to your cloud customers
[28:57.2 - 29:00.4] and you look at the AI data center architecture,
[29:01.8 - 29:05.1] does D get the sense that the mix of your products
[29:05.1 - 29:08.0] within an AI data center could be higher
[29:08.0 - 29:11.9] than what was done for a traditional data center?
[29:15.9 - 29:18.2] That's a hard one to discern.
[29:18.2 - 29:20.5] But what I do know is,
[29:20.5 - 29:24.3] we have all the solutions that our customers need
[29:24.3 - 29:26.3] that go into an AI data center.
[29:26.3 - 29:28.1] And we're currently providing them,
[29:28.1 - 29:31.7] so hence we're firing on all cylinders.
[29:31.7 - 29:35.8] We have HPS content across compute modules.
[29:36.7 - 29:39.8] We provide high-value EMS across compute modules.
[29:39.8 - 29:44.4] We have HPS content on 400 and 300 switches.
[29:44.4 - 29:46.3] And we're also in advanced development
[29:46.3 - 29:50.0] on future generation network devices.
[29:50.0 - 29:53.5] And we also, as you know, have storage solutions,
[29:53.5 - 29:56.7] both HPS and traditional as well.
[29:56.7 - 30:00.5] So our customers are really taking advantage
[30:00.5 - 30:01.7] of our full solutions.
[30:02.6 - 30:07.4] Dan, as you know, not all hyperscalers are created equal.
[30:07.4 - 30:08.6] And there are some hyperscalers
[30:08.6 - 30:11.0] that lean towards more complex,
[30:11.0 - 30:12.7] challenging product deployments.
[30:12.7 - 30:14.8] And that really works out well for us.
[30:14.8 - 30:16.5] The reason that you're seeing the amount of growth
[30:16.5 - 30:19.6] that we're showing in HPS is because those are the solutions
[30:19.6 - 30:23.0] that really fit the demand requirements
[30:23.6 - 30:24.4] of certain hyperscalers.
[30:24.4 - 30:27.4] And so as we see this shift towards more AI type
[30:27.4 - 30:32.0] of data centers, it implies more complex product,
[30:32.0 - 30:33.8] which is what we want to see.
[30:36.7 - 30:38.3] Great, that's helpful.
[30:38.3 - 30:40.8] Maybe squeezing one more in on the enterprise.
[30:40.8 - 30:42.6] The enterprise growth is expected
[30:42.6 - 30:45.1] to decelerate next quarter.
[30:45.1 - 30:46.8] Have you been successful in diversifying
[30:46.8 - 30:49.8] your hyperscale customer base in AI compute?
[30:49.8 - 30:51.7] Just given your experience with servers
[30:51.7 - 30:54.8] using custom AI chipsets.
[30:54.8 - 30:56.5] And if so, what does that wrap look like?
[30:56.5 - 31:00.1] Or is this the new run rate for the remainder of the year?
[31:00.1 - 31:01.3] Thank you.
[31:01.3 - 31:03.2] Yeah, I'll start off and let Mandeep finish.
[31:03.2 - 31:06.6] The second quarter dynamic in terms of enterprise
[31:07.6 - 31:11.9] up in the 20s, the main driver is really tough comps
[31:11.9 - 31:13.2] from a year ago.
[31:13.2 - 31:15.1] What we're seeing in the second quarter
[31:15.1 - 31:18.5] is also storage demand declining,
[31:18.5 - 31:22.7] but we're seeing very healthy steady demand
[31:22.7 - 31:24.4] from compute as well.
[31:24.4 - 31:25.8] We're also, as we mentioned earlier,
[31:25.8 - 31:29.7] happy that comms is up significantly
[31:29.7 - 31:32.8] and CCS is up significantly as well.
[31:33.8 - 31:38.8] Yeah, Dan, what I would say is that the enterprise revenues,
[31:38.8 - 31:40.2] especially as we go into the second quarter,
[31:40.2 - 31:42.9] continue to increase on a sequential basis.
[31:42.9 - 31:45.3] And as we did talk about the demand signals
[31:45.3 - 31:47.1] continue to be healthy.
[31:47.1 - 31:52.1] We do serve a number of customers on the server side,
[31:52.8 - 31:54.8] but I think what's important to look at
[31:54.8 - 31:56.5] comms and enterprise aside,
[31:56.5 - 32:00.6] is as we up-level it to total revenue with our hyperscalers,
[32:00.6 - 32:02.3] we're seeing that growth continuing.
[32:02.3 - 32:04.1] They're shifting CapEx now and then
[32:04.1 - 32:06.8] from one type of product deployment to another,
[32:06.8 - 32:10.3] but overall continuing to see strong top-line growth
[32:10.3 - 32:12.1] with hyperscalers in aggregate.
[32:14.9 - 32:15.8] Thank you.
[32:16.6 - 32:17.4] Thank you, Dan.
[32:17.4 - 32:18.6] Thank you.
[32:18.6 - 32:20.0] Thank you so much.
[32:20.0 - 32:21.8] Your next question comes from the line
[32:21.8 - 32:23.3] of Matt Sheeran of Stifel.
[32:23.3 - 32:24.5] Your line is now open.
[32:25.8 - 32:26.6] Yes, thank you.
[32:26.6 - 32:29.0] A couple of questions for me, please.
[32:29.0 - 32:33.0] One, Mandeep, just on the balance sheet,
[32:33.0 - 32:36.2] I saw that the inventory, growth inventory was down
[32:36.2 - 32:37.7] and net inventory was down
[32:37.7 - 32:40.2] where your cash deposits were also down,
[32:40.2 - 32:43.3] yet you're growing significantly.
[32:43.5 - 32:46.2] So could you talk about the dynamics going on there?
[32:46.2 - 32:49.6] And given the growth in the hyperscale business,
[32:49.6 - 32:54.6] are you seeing a shift in terms of consignment inventory
[32:54.9 - 32:58.2] that you're not passing through your cogs?
[33:00.0 - 33:01.6] Thanks for the question, Matt.
[33:01.6 - 33:05.6] So yes, strong working capital performance.
[33:05.6 - 33:08.4] Happy with the free cash flow that we generated, 65 million.
[33:08.4 - 33:09.5] Happy that we're able to raise
[33:09.5 - 33:13.2] the overall free cash flow number for the year to 250.
[33:14.1 - 33:17.2] We wanna continue to monitor how healthy our conversion is
[33:17.2 - 33:19.8] and we're comfortable with the conversion ratios
[33:19.8 - 33:20.6] that we have.
[33:20.6 - 33:24.0] And we try not to say it anymore, but as you know,
[33:24.0 - 33:27.0] over five years of positive free cash flow every quarter.
[33:27.0 - 33:30.0] Under the covers, as you're hitting on it,
[33:30.0 - 33:32.4] we are seeing some unwind on the inventory side
[33:32.4 - 33:34.9] as we were anticipating.
[33:34.9 - 33:37.4] Our inventory turns are improving
[33:37.4 - 33:39.5] and it's really a function of continuing
[33:39.5 - 33:41.0] to be collaborative with our customers
[33:41.0 - 33:42.9] and seeing lead times come in.
[33:43.6 - 33:45.7] Lead times on semis as well as passives
[33:45.7 - 33:47.6] are now under 20 weeks,
[33:47.6 - 33:50.2] which is allowing us to do some of that unwind.
[33:50.2 - 33:52.7] The deposits were also unwinding, again, as expected
[33:52.7 - 33:54.6] because we were always working with our customers saying,
[33:54.6 - 33:57.4] as long as lead times are really extended,
[33:57.4 - 34:00.4] how do we come into a model
[34:00.4 - 34:02.3] where they can help fund some of that?
[34:02.3 - 34:03.4] As they're coming in now,
[34:03.4 - 34:04.7] we're happy to return the deposits
[34:04.7 - 34:07.3] and still generate positive free cash flow.
[34:07.3 - 34:09.4] Your point on inventory build,
[34:09.4 - 34:10.4] from a dollar perspective,
[34:10.4 - 34:12.4] inventory may go up as we go through the year,
[34:12.8 - 34:15.3] but we're not seeing any unwind on the turns
[34:15.3 - 34:16.5] and we don't think that the turns
[34:16.5 - 34:19.2] are necessarily gonna take a step back.
[34:19.2 - 34:21.0] In terms of consigned, non-consigned,
[34:21.0 - 34:24.4] nothing really to note in terms of any differences.
[34:26.7 - 34:28.7] Okay, thank you for that.
[34:28.7 - 34:30.7] I wanted to just ask a question
[34:30.7 - 34:33.0] on the competitive landscape.
[34:33.0 - 34:36.1] Obviously, you're gaining market share,
[34:36.1 - 34:39.8] particularly with the one hyperscale customer.
[34:40.3 - 34:41.7] We're seeing more competition
[34:41.7 - 34:44.1] from your North American EMS peers,
[34:44.1 - 34:48.6] but also, obviously, from ODMs in Asia.
[34:48.6 - 34:51.5] Could you talk about your competitive edge
[34:51.5 - 34:54.8] and whether you expect your large customer
[34:54.8 - 34:56.7] to bring on other suppliers
[34:56.7 - 35:01.0] and what does that do to your dynamic in that relationship?
[35:02.2 - 35:03.0] Yeah, hi, Matt.
[35:04.2 - 35:07.8] Listen, second sourcing in the EMS ecosystem
[35:08.2 - 35:09.4] is nothing new.
[35:10.2 - 35:12.1] What typically happens is new programs
[35:12.1 - 35:14.4] are single sourced from the onset
[35:14.4 - 35:17.2] and over time, as the technology matures,
[35:17.2 - 35:20.1] a second source is brought into the equation,
[35:20.1 - 35:22.5] usually enabling the primary source
[35:22.5 - 35:26.1] to introduce next generation products.
[35:26.1 - 35:30.6] And this is currently at play in some respects.
[35:32.0 - 35:33.2] There's a competitive dynamic
[35:33.2 - 35:35.4] where a second source is being brought on
[35:36.3 - 35:38.2] to help our customers.
[35:38.2 - 35:40.4] In other cases, we're the benefactor
[35:40.4 - 35:42.7] of being a second source to some of our competition,
[35:42.7 - 35:43.9] so it goes both ways.
[35:44.8 - 35:47.0] Also, I would add that on HPS products,
[35:47.0 - 35:50.0] there's a little bit of a different dynamic at play.
[35:50.0 - 35:52.4] HPS products are typically single sourced
[35:52.4 - 35:54.1] for the life of the program,
[35:54.1 - 35:57.0] and that's given the stringent qualification process
[35:57.9 - 36:01.2] and also next generation products
[36:01.2 - 36:03.0] typically are awarded to the incumbent,
[36:03.0 - 36:06.0] assuming strong initial performance
[36:06.0 - 36:09.3] because switching costs are also prohibitive.
[36:09.3 - 36:14.3] And again, within our AI, ML, data center offerings,
[36:15.2 - 36:17.8] a lot of our high value EMS programs
[36:17.8 - 36:20.5] are transitioning to HPS products over time
[36:20.5 - 36:22.0] because of the value add we're able
[36:22.0 - 36:24.1] to bring into the equation,
[36:24.1 - 36:25.6] which we think is a competitive edge
[36:25.6 - 36:27.8] versus our EMS peers.
[36:27.8 - 36:29.3] Matt, maybe just to add on one point,
[36:29.3 - 36:31.5] which is, as we all know,
[36:31.5 - 36:33.4] the pie continues to get bigger.
[36:33.4 - 36:36.6] The capex spend across the top hyperscalers
[36:36.6 - 36:39.5] who we all support is growing materially this year.
[36:39.5 - 36:40.7] Everyone knows that.
[36:40.7 - 36:43.0] The expectation is that there's gonna be
[36:43.0 - 36:45.3] a good level of growth going into next year as well.
[36:45.3 - 36:47.2] And so as the pie continues to get bigger,
[36:47.2 - 36:49.2] our revenue with the hyperscalers
[36:49.2 - 36:50.8] is also continuing to grow.
[36:52.3 - 36:53.8] When second sourcing is happening
[36:53.8 - 36:55.6] on less complex products,
[36:55.6 - 36:56.8] the positive way to look at that
[36:56.8 - 36:58.8] is it allows us to redeploy capacity
[36:58.8 - 37:00.2] to the more complex products,
[37:00.2 - 37:01.3] and the more complex products
[37:01.3 - 37:02.6] are what Rob just mentioned,
[37:02.6 - 37:05.2] whether it be HPS or heavy engineering content.
[37:05.2 - 37:08.4] And so there has not been any dynamics
[37:08.4 - 37:09.4] on the competitive landscape,
[37:09.4 - 37:11.4] I would say, that has surprised us.
[37:11.4 - 37:13.2] It's really playing out as expected.
[37:14.1 - 37:15.0] Okay, great.
[37:15.0 - 37:16.8] Just in line with that,
[37:17.6 - 37:19.2] are you still, you've talked about
[37:19.2 - 37:22.8] being sort of exclusive in terms of the AI ML programs.
[37:22.8 - 37:25.3] Is that still the case with your big customer?
[37:26.7 - 37:27.8] No, I wouldn't say so.
[37:27.8 - 37:30.1] I would say it's on a program by program basis.
[37:31.0 - 37:32.4] Some programs were exclusive,
[37:32.4 - 37:33.5] some programs were not,
[37:33.5 - 37:36.2] and those dynamics, as I mentioned earlier,
[37:36.2 - 37:37.3] might change over time.
[37:38.4 - 37:39.6] Okay, great.
[37:39.6 - 37:41.4] Through the product life cycle.
[37:41.4 - 37:42.2] Got it.
[37:42.2 - 37:43.6] Okay, thanks very much.
[37:43.6 - 37:44.7] Yeah.
[37:44.7 - 37:45.6] Thanks, Ben.
[37:46.6 - 37:47.9] Thank you so much.
[37:47.9 - 37:49.5] Your next question comes from the line
[37:49.5 - 37:52.5] of Thanos Miskopoulos of BMO Capital Markets.
[37:52.5 - 37:53.6] Your line is now open.
[37:54.6 - 37:56.0] Hi, good morning.
[37:56.0 - 37:59.0] If you look at your CCS growth in the quarter
[37:59.0 - 38:01.3] outside of your largest customer,
[38:01.3 - 38:03.6] that growth rate's been a fair bit more subdued.
[38:03.6 - 38:04.4] Is that just a function
[38:04.4 - 38:07.2] of how you've been prioritizing capacity?
[38:07.2 - 38:10.2] Does it have to do with perhaps some tough year of your comps
[38:10.2 - 38:12.2] on the programs you're exposed to,
[38:12.2 - 38:13.1] those other hyperscalers,
[38:13.1 - 38:15.5] or any other you could provide would be helpful?
[38:16.9 - 38:19.8] I'll start off and I'll let Mandit finish,
[38:19.8 - 38:24.8] but it's not a function of capacity, I would say.
[38:24.8 - 38:27.4] You know, we do have ample capacity at our sites
[38:27.4 - 38:31.8] and we're also building forward, investing forward
[38:31.8 - 38:33.5] to make sure it stays that way.
[38:33.5 - 38:35.3] As we mentioned in the script,
[38:35.3 - 38:39.2] our coolant factory just came online
[38:39.2 - 38:43.2] and we have additional Thailand capacity
[38:43.2 - 38:45.8] that's coming online in the second half of 25,
[38:45.8 - 38:47.9] but currently ahead of schedule.
[38:47.9 - 38:52.0] It really has to go with the buying patterns
[38:52.0 - 38:54.5] and capacity expansion plans of a hyperscalers.
[38:54.5 - 38:56.8] They all have different investment cycles
[38:56.8 - 38:58.0] and different expansion plans.
[38:58.0 - 39:00.1] So it's kind of their bio rhythms
[39:00.1 - 39:03.3] and we're able to kind of happy to support each of them.
[39:03.3 - 39:04.7] Some are heavier this year,
[39:04.7 - 39:07.5] some might be heavier next year.
[39:07.5 - 39:09.2] And just to build on that, Dana,
[39:09.2 - 39:11.2] so the growth that we saw in the first quarter
[39:11.2 - 39:12.8] that you're seeing in comps
[39:12.8 - 39:17.2] is being started off by our largest customer.
[39:17.2 - 39:19.4] What we're encouraged with is that the growth
[39:19.4 - 39:21.7] that we're seeing in comps going into Q2
[39:21.7 - 39:24.5] is now spreading to the rest of the hyperscaler customers.
[39:24.5 - 39:27.3] And so while the point you made is very valid
[39:27.3 - 39:28.8] as you look at the first quarter,
[39:28.8 - 39:31.7] when we're looking at it in terms of the full year,
[39:31.7 - 39:34.3] we are seeing growth across a number of customers,
[39:34.3 - 39:35.3] not just one or two.
[39:37.2 - 39:38.3] Okay, that's helpful.
[39:38.3 - 39:41.1] And with respect to margins,
[39:41.1 - 39:43.2] maybe too early to talk about 2025,
[39:43.2 - 39:47.0] but as we think about the fact that you've got this weakness
[39:47.0 - 39:49.9] in capital equipment and industrial,
[39:49.9 - 39:54.1] which might improve later in the year and into next year,
[39:54.8 - 39:57.4] and you've got the growing HPS mix,
[39:57.4 - 40:00.7] is there any reason for why we should not expect margins
[40:00.7 - 40:02.4] to be sustainable to expand next year?
[40:02.4 - 40:05.0] Any offsetting constraints we should think about?
[40:06.6 - 40:09.7] Yeah, I'll start off and rockin' that on if needed.
[40:11.0 - 40:12.7] We're happy with the way that the margins
[40:12.7 - 40:13.6] are coming together.
[40:13.6 - 40:17.6] Clearly 6.2% in the first quarter, highest in our history.
[40:17.6 - 40:21.8] And the outlook now that we're providing is 6.1%
[40:21.9 - 40:24.3] and when achieved,
[40:24.3 - 40:26.5] will be the highest in the company's history.
[40:26.5 - 40:30.1] From a mixed perspective, hyperscaler margins,
[40:30.1 - 40:32.6] because of the level of complexity that is involved,
[40:32.6 - 40:35.8] is accretive to the overall company.
[40:35.8 - 40:40.0] And so as we continue to grow hyperscaler revenues,
[40:40.0 - 40:43.4] we are looking to maintain CCS margins,
[40:43.4 - 40:44.9] plus or minus a little bit.
[40:44.9 - 40:47.2] The opportunity, I think, as you talk about for next year,
[40:47.2 - 40:49.1] really goes to ATS.
[40:49.1 - 40:53.1] So our outlook for ATS right now is to be below 5%
[40:53.1 - 40:54.6] on a full year basis.
[40:54.6 - 40:56.6] They did 4.7 in the first quarter.
[40:56.6 - 40:58.9] But to your point, as the demand returns
[40:58.9 - 41:02.6] in capital equipment, which is profitable, by the way,
[41:02.6 - 41:06.0] but as the demand comes back, we get leverage benefits.
[41:06.0 - 41:10.2] And as industrial, which is a strong margin business,
[41:10.2 - 41:12.7] contributes more, both of those will help
[41:12.7 - 41:14.0] expand margins in ATS.
[41:14.0 - 41:16.7] And so we think that we have some opportunities
[41:16.7 - 41:17.6] going into 25.
[41:19.7 - 41:20.6] All right, I'll pass the line.
[41:20.6 - 41:21.7] Thank you.
[41:21.7 - 41:22.5] Thanks, Dennis.
[41:22.5 - 41:23.6] Thanks.
[41:23.6 - 41:25.2] Thank you so much.
[41:25.2 - 41:27.8] Your next question comes from the line of Jesse Pietlak
[41:27.8 - 41:29.5] of Coremark Securities.
[41:29.5 - 41:30.5] Please go ahead.
[41:32.0 - 41:33.2] Okay, good morning.
[41:33.2 - 41:36.0] When you think about the increased guidance for 2024
[41:36.0 - 41:39.1] in the context of the numbers you laid out for 2025
[41:39.1 - 41:41.3] and 2026 of the November Investor Day,
[41:42.3 - 41:43.9] like is the increase really,
[41:43.9 - 41:47.0] is it just like you said, the pipe getting bigger,
[41:47.0 - 41:50.0] or is there some demand that's maybe being pulled forward?
[41:52.4 - 41:53.2] Yeah, hi, Jesse.
[41:53.2 - 41:55.6] First of all, welcome to the call
[41:55.6 - 42:00.6] and really pleased to see Coremark providing some coverage.
[42:00.8 - 42:02.0] To answer your question,
[42:03.1 - 42:04.9] the demand signals continue to be healthy
[42:04.9 - 42:06.1] across the hyperscalers.
[42:07.0 - 42:09.5] To say that pull-ins are not happening
[42:09.5 - 42:11.5] probably wouldn't be accurate because as you see,
[42:11.5 - 42:14.0] we came in above the high end of our guidance rate in Q2,
[42:14.0 - 42:15.4] or excuse me, in Q1.
[42:15.8 - 42:17.9] And some of that was fulfilling demand
[42:17.9 - 42:20.6] that dropped in as we went through the quarter.
[42:20.6 - 42:21.6] As Rob had talked about,
[42:21.6 - 42:23.4] because it's not a 12-month rolling forecast,
[42:23.4 - 42:25.3] we don't have clear visibility
[42:25.3 - 42:28.9] to how that revenue that may have been out a few quarters
[42:28.9 - 42:30.7] is getting backfilled.
[42:30.7 - 42:33.7] But at the higher customer level,
[42:33.7 - 42:36.3] we're not seeing shifts in the demand patterns.
[42:36.3 - 42:38.6] And so what that would imply is that,
[42:38.6 - 42:40.0] yes, we're continuing to see strong growth
[42:40.0 - 42:40.9] in the back half of this year,
[42:40.9 - 42:43.4] as we talked about at the beginning of the Q&A,
[42:43.4 - 42:45.3] double-digit growth rates.
[42:46.1 - 42:48.0] The demand signals continue to be positive
[42:48.0 - 42:51.6] for data center deployments going into 2025.
[42:51.6 - 42:54.7] But then to your point, we're already now ahead,
[42:54.7 - 42:57.2] or pretty close to what our 2025 outlook was
[42:57.2 - 42:59.6] in April of 2024.
[42:59.6 - 43:01.6] And so we'll wait for six months
[43:01.6 - 43:04.6] to really give a better outlook for 2025.
[43:04.6 - 43:06.5] But right now, we're not feeling like
[43:06.5 - 43:09.4] it's feeling from 2025.
[43:09.4 - 43:10.6] The demand signals just seem to be
[43:10.6 - 43:12.2] like the overall tide is rising.
[43:13.2 - 43:14.7] Okay, that's helpful.
[43:14.7 - 43:16.9] And then can you just comment a little bit
[43:16.9 - 43:20.5] on what you're seeing in the networking side of things,
[43:20.5 - 43:21.6] kind of beyond the hyperscalers,
[43:21.6 - 43:23.4] more in the traditional cloud space?
[43:27.1 - 43:31.3] Yeah, most of our networking business
[43:31.3 - 43:34.8] is actually going to the cloud providers
[43:34.8 - 43:39.0] in terms of 400 and 800G switches.
[43:39.0 - 43:44.0] On the OEM side, we are seeing continued softness
[43:46.7 - 43:50.4] as the industry burns through some excess inventory.
[43:50.4 - 43:52.8] We do see some of that recovering
[43:52.8 - 43:54.3] in the back half of the year.
[43:55.7 - 43:59.4] Yeah, as you know, the OEM side of the business
[43:59.4 - 44:01.5] are exposed not just to hyperscalers,
[44:01.5 - 44:03.0] but also to small, medium businesses.
[44:03.0 - 44:06.3] And those capital type of deployments
[44:06.3 - 44:11.1] have been impacted from the macroeconomic conditions,
[44:11.1 - 44:12.3] but we don't believe that that demand
[44:12.3 - 44:14.2] is going to be permanently gone.
[44:14.2 - 44:15.7] But there does continue to be a slowdown
[44:15.7 - 44:17.4] outside of the hyperscaler market.
[44:18.5 - 44:20.4] Okay, I'll pass the line.
[44:22.0 - 44:22.8] Thanks, Jesse.
[44:23.7 - 44:24.5] Thanks, Jesse.
[44:25.8 - 44:27.3] Thank you so much.
[44:27.3 - 44:28.8] Your next question comes from the line
[44:28.8 - 44:31.5] of Paul Treiber of RBC Capital Markets.
[44:31.5 - 44:32.6] Your line is now open.
[44:33.7 - 44:35.3] Oh, thanks and good morning.
[44:35.4 - 44:37.4] You've been very successful,
[44:37.4 - 44:38.6] you're the largest customer
[44:38.6 - 44:42.0] over the last couple of years or year and a half.
[44:42.0 - 44:44.4] What's your visibility and strategy
[44:44.4 - 44:47.0] to try to replicate that degree of success
[44:47.0 - 44:49.2] with other hyperscaler customers?
[44:51.0 - 44:54.5] Oh, I would say we are actually replicating
[44:54.5 - 44:56.5] that success with other customers.
[44:56.5 - 44:59.2] I mean, we have very strong positions
[44:59.2 - 45:03.3] with the majority of the big hyperscalers.
[45:03.3 - 45:05.7] We've won a number of new programs
[45:05.7 - 45:08.1] with those hyperscalers that are either in development
[45:08.1 - 45:10.8] or currently in ramping.
[45:10.8 - 45:15.2] So we're not solely reliant on that one customer.
[45:15.2 - 45:17.4] We have actually very healthy portfolios
[45:17.4 - 45:19.2] across a number of hyperscalers
[45:19.2 - 45:20.8] and across a number of platforms
[45:20.8 - 45:22.3] within those hyperscalers.
[45:22.3 - 45:24.4] It just so happens that our number one customer
[45:24.4 - 45:27.0] happens to be in heavy investment mode right now.
[45:27.0 - 45:30.7] And those are driving some of the concentration numbers.
[45:30.7 - 45:34.5] Over time, those investment levels might come down,
[45:34.5 - 45:37.6] but other hyperscaler investment levels will increase.
[45:37.6 - 45:40.3] So our overall hyperscaler portfolio
[45:40.3 - 45:42.0] is actually very, very healthy.
[45:44.6 - 45:46.9] That's helpful to hear.
[45:48.4 - 45:50.6] The earlier comments on being comfortable
[45:50.6 - 45:52.9] with a customer concentration,
[45:52.9 - 45:56.8] is that, we're not getting to a specific outlook
[45:56.8 - 45:60.0] for what you see in the customer concentration.
[46:00.0 - 46:00.9] Could you just give us a sense
[46:00.9 - 46:03.2] of why you're comfortable with it
[46:04.6 - 46:07.4] at 34% this past quarter?
[46:08.6 - 46:12.2] Yeah, because it's not a single program.
[46:13.3 - 46:18.2] It's multiple programs across multiple technologies
[46:19.4 - 46:22.4] crossing a decade,
[46:22.4 - 46:26.6] or even over a decade of past relationships
[46:26.6 - 46:28.7] and with continued strong performance,
[46:28.7 - 46:31.6] not just on high value EMS,
[46:31.6 - 46:33.8] but across engineering engagements as well.
[46:33.8 - 46:36.1] So it's a very sticky relationship,
[46:36.1 - 46:40.5] one backed by mutual respect and high performance.
[46:40.5 - 46:43.4] We never take these things for granted,
[46:43.4 - 46:46.6] but we're happy with the breadth of solutions
[46:46.6 - 46:48.4] that we're providing this customer.
[46:50.7 - 46:52.0] And then just lastly,
[46:52.0 - 46:53.8] just on the capacity side of the equation,
[46:53.8 - 46:56.6] I mean, you mentioned that you do have capacity.
[46:56.6 - 46:59.1] Can you speak to your capacity utilization
[46:59.1 - 47:02.8] and how it compares to what you've historically averaged?
[47:02.8 - 47:06.8] And then are you seeing additional opportunities
[47:06.8 - 47:09.3] with your customers for co-investments
[47:10.4 - 47:12.2] in capacity expansion?
[47:13.6 - 47:18.6] Yeah, so capacity or utilization is extremely high
[47:19.2 - 47:21.8] in our Asia sites where the majority
[47:21.8 - 47:25.0] of our AI demand is fulfilled.
[47:25.9 - 47:30.2] Within our business, highly utilized sites
[47:30.2 - 47:32.8] and highly leveraged sites are very profitable sites.
[47:32.8 - 47:34.2] And that's what you're seeing in our results.
[47:34.2 - 47:37.6] And we carefully manage our capacity.
[47:37.6 - 47:41.6] We have decided to invest in some additional capacity
[47:41.6 - 47:44.6] and we think those investments should take care of us
[47:44.6 - 47:47.0] for the next clip of time.
[47:47.0 - 47:48.4] We don't foresee any need
[47:48.4 - 47:50.9] for any additional co-investments at this time.
[47:50.9 - 47:53.8] We think the expansions that are underway
[47:53.8 - 47:55.2] should take care of us for a period of time
[47:55.2 - 47:57.5] and keep those high utilization rates.
[47:57.5 - 47:58.4] Yeah.
[47:58.4 - 47:59.3] Paul, just to add on to that,
[47:59.3 - 48:01.4] in November when we gave our investor day,
[48:01.4 - 48:04.7] we had provided a revenue outlook going out to 2026.
[48:05.6 - 48:07.8] A range was nine and a half to $10 billion.
[48:07.8 - 48:11.0] And we had stated at that time that we believe
[48:11.0 - 48:14.4] that we have the footprint now to fulfill that.
[48:14.4 - 48:16.5] So we don't need to greenfield a brand new factory
[48:16.5 - 48:18.4] in a new country in order to keep up
[48:18.4 - 48:20.0] with that demand outlook.
[48:20.0 - 48:22.5] And so it's one of the things that we're pleased about
[48:22.6 - 48:24.6] is that we believe we're able to,
[48:24.6 - 48:26.6] while the CapEx may be a little bit elevated,
[48:26.6 - 48:28.9] more or less in line with our historical levels
[48:29.9 - 48:31.8] while still being able to grow revenue.
[48:33.8 - 48:35.2] Thanks for the information.
[48:36.4 - 48:37.2] Thanks, Paul.
[48:38.6 - 48:40.1] Thank you so much.
[48:40.1 - 48:42.7] And as a reminder, if you wish to ask a question,
[48:42.7 - 48:44.3] please press star one.
[48:45.7 - 48:47.6] And your next question comes from the line
[48:47.6 - 48:50.2] of Todd Couplant of CIBC.
[48:50.2 - 48:51.4] Your line is now open.
[48:52.6 - 48:53.5] Great.
[48:53.5 - 48:54.4] Thanks and good morning, everyone.
[48:54.4 - 48:58.9] I wanted to ask specifically about compute.
[48:58.9 - 49:02.9] We're seeing that decelerate into Q2
[49:02.9 - 49:05.0] and into the second half of the year.
[49:05.0 - 49:08.0] What factors are you looking for
[49:08.0 - 49:10.6] in terms of re-accelerating that line?
[49:10.6 - 49:13.2] And give us any indication
[49:13.2 - 49:14.6] on when you think that might happen.
[49:14.6 - 49:15.5] Thanks a lot.
[49:18.0 - 49:18.9] Yeah, I'll start.
[49:18.9 - 49:23.9] So compute in Q1 was up over 130% year-over-year.
[49:28.6 - 49:33.2] Compute in Q2 is up in the 70 percentage range
[49:33.2 - 49:34.2] on a year-over-year base.
[49:34.2 - 49:35.5] I would not call that,
[49:35.5 - 49:38.5] at least in the first half of year, decelerating.
[49:38.5 - 49:41.0] As we go into the second half of the year,
[49:41.0 - 49:44.2] some of that is, at least our outlook is driven
[49:44.2 - 49:47.8] by a little bit of murkiness as we exit the year.
[49:48.0 - 49:53.0] Broadly speaking, compute volume and demand
[49:53.5 - 49:56.2] remains a material constraint.
[49:56.2 - 49:59.1] So again, demand exceeds supply
[49:59.1 - 50:01.8] and as material availability becomes available,
[50:01.8 - 50:06.3] that might give us an opportunity to increase our output.
[50:06.3 - 50:07.7] But this is the visibility that we have
[50:07.7 - 50:09.0] at this point in time.
[50:09.0 - 50:12.0] Yeah, and Todd, I would maybe just add to that to say,
[50:13.7 - 50:16.0] as we talked about when the demand cycle
[50:16.0 - 50:17.7] for hyperscalers started to really accelerate
[50:17.7 - 50:19.1] in the middle of last year,
[50:19.1 - 50:23.1] is that we believed it was going to start with compute
[50:23.1 - 50:24.7] and that it was gonna start migrating
[50:24.7 - 50:28.6] over to AI type of networking,
[50:28.6 - 50:30.8] which is 400-D switches,
[50:30.8 - 50:32.8] but moving into 800-D switches as well.
[50:32.8 - 50:35.0] And so we're starting to see that.
[50:35.0 - 50:38.1] Customers have a fixed level of capital
[50:38.1 - 50:40.7] and they choose on where they deploy that capital.
[50:40.7 - 50:42.1] And what we're seeing right now
[50:42.1 - 50:44.4] is more of a shift toward the comm side
[50:44.4 - 50:46.7] because communications is a larger part of our portfolio.
[50:46.7 - 50:49.5] We think that we're gonna come out more ahead
[50:49.5 - 50:50.9] because of that.
[50:50.9 - 50:53.7] Not to say that compute is going away
[50:53.7 - 50:55.4] because the other dynamic that we have to keep in mind
[50:55.4 - 50:58.2] is that the comps now are becoming quite high.
[50:58.2 - 51:01.7] But overall, we are seeing a healthy demand
[51:01.7 - 51:03.4] coming out of Q1 and going into Q2.
[51:05.1 - 51:07.3] And if I could just follow up on that.
[51:07.3 - 51:09.8] Within compute, you've had this debate
[51:09.8 - 51:12.0] on merchant silicon versus custom silicon,
[51:12.0 - 51:15.0] and then obviously the hyperscalers are all coming up
[51:15.0 - 51:18.9] with their own custom processors.
[51:18.9 - 51:20.3] And that's yet to come.
[51:20.3 - 51:21.3] I guess I would have thought
[51:21.3 - 51:23.8] that that might have started to flow into your business.
[51:23.8 - 51:28.2] And I'm just wondering if you could help bridge
[51:28.2 - 51:29.6] that gap of understanding.
[51:29.6 - 51:30.5] Thanks a lot.
[51:32.1 - 51:36.2] Yeah, Todd, we are definitely heavily tilted
[51:36.2 - 51:39.6] towards custom silicon versus merchant silicon.
[51:39.6 - 51:44.6] And we have been the benefactor of that switch.
[51:44.8 - 51:47.6] As you see from the announcements in the press,
[51:47.6 - 51:50.7] the hyperscalers are continuing to invest
[51:50.7 - 51:52.3] in custom silicon.
[51:53.3 - 51:58.3] And as these new custom silicon comes to market,
[51:59.7 - 52:03.8] we feel confident that we'll be able to get access to them
[52:03.8 - 52:05.7] and also provide these types of solutions
[52:05.7 - 52:07.2] to our customers moving forward.
[52:07.2 - 52:09.4] So that trend is continuing,
[52:11.4 - 52:13.4] and I think we're taking advantage of it.
[52:15.4 - 52:16.3] Thanks for the call.
[52:16.3 - 52:17.2] Appreciate it.
[52:19.4 - 52:20.9] Thanks, Todd.
[52:20.9 - 52:22.1] Thank you so much.
[52:24.4 - 52:27.0] And there are no further questions at this time, presenters.
[52:27.0 - 52:28.3] I would now like to turn the call back
[52:28.3 - 52:31.0] to our speaker, Rob Mijones, for closing remarks.
[52:31.9 - 52:33.2] Thank you.
[52:33.2 - 52:34.4] Overall, I'm very pleased
[52:34.4 - 52:36.3] that we posted another solid quarter
[52:36.3 - 52:38.5] and the strong momentum is giving us confidence
[52:38.5 - 52:41.5] to increase our outlook for 2024.
[52:41.5 - 52:44.4] I'm also very pleased by our continued strong execution
[52:44.4 - 52:47.1] and encouraged with our strong market position,
[52:47.1 - 52:49.4] especially with some new products like 800G
[52:49.4 - 52:51.6] and strong and growing markets.
[52:51.6 - 52:54.0] I thank you all for joining today's call,
[52:54.0 - 52:56.5] and we look forward to updating you next quarter.
[52:58.6 - 53:01.3] Thank you, presenters, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
[53:01.3 - 53:03.0] This concludes today's conference call.
[53:03.0 - 53:04.3] Thank you for your participation,
[53:04.3 - 53:05.7] and you may now disconnect.
[53:05.7 - 53:07.0] Have a good day.
