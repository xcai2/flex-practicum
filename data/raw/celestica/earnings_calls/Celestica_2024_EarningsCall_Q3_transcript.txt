[03:22.0 - 03:26.0] Let me now turn the call over to Rob.
[03:26.0 - 03:30.0] Thank you, Craig, and good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call.
[03:30.0 - 03:33.0] In the third quarter, our strong momentum continued,
[03:33.0 - 03:41.0] achieving revenues of $2.5 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.04 above the high end of our guidance ranges.
[03:41.0 - 03:46.0] The outperformance was driven by continued strong demand in our CCS business,
[03:46.0 - 03:52.0] coupled with strong non-IFRS operating margin of 6.7%.
[03:52.0 - 03:56.0] Our CCS segment revenues increased 42% year-over-year,
[03:56.0 - 04:01.0] driven by continued investment from our hyperscaler customers on data center infrastructure,
[04:01.0 - 04:06.0] including very strong demand for our networking switches within our HPS portfolio.
[04:06.0 - 04:11.0] The solid revenue growth and improved mix contributed to healthy margin expansion,
[04:11.0 - 04:19.0] as our CCS segment margins of 7.6% was up by 140 basis points versus last year.
[04:19.0 - 04:23.0] In our ATS segment, revenues were 5% lower year-over-year,
[04:23.0 - 04:26.0] driven by continued softness in our industrial business,
[04:26.0 - 04:30.0] where the demand environment remains dynamic across a number of our submarkets,
[04:30.0 - 04:36.0] partly offsetting those declines, was continued strength in our A&D and capital equipment businesses,
[04:36.0 - 04:42.0] which saw growth of 15% and 31%, respectively, in the third quarter.
[04:42.0 - 04:46.0] Overall, we are pleased with our very strong performance this year.
[04:46.0 - 04:54.0] Looking ahead, we feel we are well positioned to continue to capitalize on a number of high-value opportunities across our portfolio
[04:54.0 - 04:58.0] and strengthen our competitive position in key end markets.
[04:58.0 - 05:00.0] I would now like to turn the call over to Mandeep,
[05:00.0 - 05:04.0] who will provide a detailed review of our third quarter performance,
[05:04.0 - 05:08.0] our guidance for the fourth quarter of 2024, and our outlook for the full year.
[05:08.0 - 05:11.0] Mandeep, over to you.
[05:11.0 - 05:12.0] Thank you, Rob.
[05:12.0 - 05:19.0] Third quarter revenue came in at $2.50 billion, up 22%, and above the high end of our guidance range.
[05:19.0 - 05:23.0] The growth was supported by strong demand from hyperscaler customers in our CCS segment,
[05:24.0 - 05:31.0] partially offset by lower revenues in our ATS segment, driven by the anticipated softness in our industrial business.
[05:31.0 - 05:36.0] Third quarter non-IFRS operating margin of 6.7% was an improvement of 100 basis points,
[05:36.0 - 05:41.0] driven by improved mix and operating leverage from higher volumes in our CCS segment.
[05:41.0 - 05:49.0] Our third quarter adjusted earnings per share was $1.04, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range and was 39 cents higher.
[05:49.0 - 05:54.0] This, once again, marked our highest quarterly result in company history.
[05:54.0 - 05:58.0] Our third quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 21%.
[05:58.0 - 06:00.0] Moving on to our segment performance.
[06:00.0 - 06:06.0] ATS segment revenues for the third quarter were $814 million, down 5%,
[06:06.0 - 06:10.0] slightly more than our expectations of a low single-digit decrease.
[06:10.0 - 06:14.0] The decrease in ATS segment revenue was driven by lower demand in our industrial business.
[06:14.0 - 06:19.0] The decline was partially offset by solid growth in our aerospace and defense and capital equipment businesses.
[06:19.0 - 06:25.0] ATS segment revenue accounted for 33% of total revenues in the third quarter.
[06:25.0 - 06:31.0] Our third quarter CCS segment revenue of $1.69 billion was up by 42%,
[06:31.0 - 06:36.0] driven by very strong growth in both our enterprise and communications end market.
[06:36.0 - 06:42.0] CCS segment revenue accounted for 67% of total company revenues in the third quarter.
[06:42.0 - 06:48.0] Revenue in our enterprise end market was up by 38%, above our expectations of a mid-30s percentage increase,
[06:48.0 - 06:54.0] driven by stronger than expected demand due to program dynamics in our storage business.
[06:54.0 - 07:01.0] Revenue in our communications end market grew by 45%, which was better than our expectations of a low 30s percentage increase.
[07:01.0 - 07:07.0] The growth in our communications end market was driven primarily by increased demand for our HPS networking switches.
[07:07.0 - 07:13.0] HPS revenues grew by 54%, reaching $761 million in the third quarter,
[07:13.0 - 07:16.0] which accounted for 30% of total company revenues.
[07:16.0 - 07:22.0] The very strong growth in our HPS portfolio was driven by hyperscaler customer demand for our 400G networking switches,
[07:22.0 - 07:27.0] as well as ramping programs in 800G switches.
[07:27.0 - 07:29.0] Turning to segment margin.
[07:29.0 - 07:34.0] ATS segment margin in the third quarter was 4.8%, down 10 basis points,
[07:34.0 - 07:37.0] driven primarily by lower operating leverage in our industrial end market,
[07:37.0 - 07:42.0] partially offset by improvement in capital equipment and A&E.
[07:42.0 - 07:47.0] CCS segment margin during the quarter was 7.6%, up 140 basis points,
[07:47.0 - 07:51.0] driven by greater operating leverage and improved mix.
[07:51.0 - 07:56.0] During the third quarter, we had two customers that accounted for more than 10% of total revenue,
[07:56.0 - 08:01.0] representing 25% and 12% of sales for the quarter, respectively.
[08:01.0 - 08:04.0] We remain comfortable with the levels of customer concentration in our portfolio,
[08:04.0 - 08:11.0] as we believe that we maintain appropriate levels of diversification across multiple programs with our largest customers.
[08:11.0 - 08:14.0] Moving on to some additional financial metrics.
[08:14.0 - 08:21.0] IFRS net earnings for the third quarter were $92 million, or 77 cents per share, up 10 cents.
[08:21.0 - 08:26.0] Adjusted gross margin for the third quarter was 10.7%, up 90 basis points,
[08:26.0 - 08:30.0] driven by operating leverage and production efficiencies in our CCS segment.
[08:30.0 - 08:36.0] Our third quarter adjusted ROIC was 28.6%, an improvement of 7.1%,
[08:36.0 - 08:42.0] driven by higher operating profitability and strong working capital management.
[08:42.0 - 08:44.0] Moving on to working capital.
[08:44.0 - 08:48.0] At the end of the third quarter, our inventory balance was $1.83 billion,
[08:48.0 - 08:54.0] down $26 million sequentially and down $434 million year over year.
[08:54.0 - 08:57.0] Cash deposits were $521 million at the end of the quarter,
[08:58.0 - 09:04.0] lower by $55 million sequentially, and $354 million lower year over year.
[09:04.0 - 09:11.0] As expected, we continue to return some of our cash deposits back to customers as gross inventories move lower.
[09:11.0 - 09:15.0] Cash cycle days during the third quarter were 66, up two days sequentially,
[09:15.0 - 09:19.0] and six days lower than the prior year period.
[09:19.0 - 09:21.0] Moving on to our cash flow.
[09:21.0 - 09:26.0] Capital expenditures for the quarter were $46 million, or approximately 1.8% of revenue,
[09:26.0 - 09:30.0] compared with 1.3% in the third quarter of 2023.
[09:30.0 - 09:36.0] We expect our capital expenditures for 2024 to be approximately 1.75% of revenue,
[09:36.0 - 09:41.0] in line with our previous outlook of between 1.5% and 2%.
[09:41.0 - 09:45.0] In the third quarter, we generated $75 million of adjusted free cash flow,
[09:45.0 - 09:48.0] compared to $34 million in the prior year period.
[09:48.0 - 09:53.0] 2024 year-to-date, we have generated $203 million of adjusted free cash flow,
[09:53.0 - 09:59.0] compared to $110 million during the first three quarters of 2023.
[09:59.0 - 10:02.0] Now moving on to some additional key metrics.
[10:02.0 - 10:06.0] At the end of the third quarter, our cash balance was $399 million.
[10:06.0 - 10:11.0] In combination with our $750 million of borrowing capacity under our revolver,
[10:11.0 - 10:15.0] this provides us with approximately $1.1 billion in total liquidity,
[10:15.0 - 10:19.0] which we believe is sufficient to meet our anticipated business needs.
[10:19.0 - 10:23.0] Our gross debt at the end of the third quarter was $746 million,
[10:23.0 - 10:28.0] leaving us with a net debt position of $347 million.
[10:28.0 - 10:34.0] Our gross debt to non-IFRS trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 1.0 turns,
[10:34.0 - 10:40.0] down 0.1 turns both sequentially and compared to the prior year.
[10:41.0 - 10:42.0] As of September 30th,
[10:42.0 - 10:47.0] we were compliant with all financial covenants under our credit agreement.
[10:47.0 - 10:48.0] During the third quarter,
[10:48.0 - 10:51.0] we repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares for cancellation
[10:51.0 - 10:53.0] under our normal course issuer bid
[10:53.0 - 10:56.0] at an average cost of approximately $44 per share
[10:56.0 - 10:59.0] for a total deployment of $100 million.
[10:59.0 - 11:02.0] This step up in purchases compared to recent quarters
[11:02.0 - 11:05.0] is reflective of our commitment to be active on an opportunistic basis
[11:05.0 - 11:08.0] when we feel there is a dislocation in our share price
[11:08.0 - 11:11.0] relative to our financial performance and outlook.
[11:11.0 - 11:15.0] Year-to-date, we have purchased a total of approximately 2.9 million shares
[11:15.0 - 11:20.0] at a cost of $127 million under the program.
[11:20.0 - 11:23.0] Now turning to our guidance for the fourth quarter of 2024.
[11:23.0 - 11:28.0] Fourth quarter revenues are expected to be in the range of $2.425 billion
[11:28.0 - 11:30.0] to $2.575 billion,
[11:30.0 - 11:35.0] which if achieved would represent growth of 17% at the midpoint.
[11:35.0 - 11:37.0] Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share
[11:37.0 - 11:41.0] are expected to be in the range of $0.99 to $1.09,
[11:41.0 - 11:45.0] which if achieved would represent an improvement of $0.28 per share
[11:45.0 - 11:48.0] or 37% at the midpoint.
[11:48.0 - 11:49.0] If the midpoint of our revenue
[11:49.0 - 11:52.0] and adjusted EPS guidance ranges are achieved,
[11:52.0 - 11:55.0] non-IFRS operating margin would be 6.7%,
[11:55.0 - 11:58.0] which would represent an increase of 70 basis points
[11:58.0 - 12:01.0] compared to the same period last year.
[12:01.0 - 12:03.0] Our adjusted SG&A expense for the fourth quarter
[12:03.0 - 12:07.0] is expected to be in the range of $78 to $80 million.
[12:07.0 - 12:10.0] We anticipate our adjusted effective tax rate for the fourth quarter
[12:10.0 - 12:14.0] to be approximately 21%.
[12:14.0 - 12:18.0] Now turning to our end market outlook for the fourth quarter of 2024.
[12:18.0 - 12:22.0] In our ETS segment, we anticipate revenue to be flat year-over-year,
[12:22.0 - 12:24.0] driven by continued growth in A&E
[12:24.0 - 12:26.0] and recovering demand in capital equipment,
[12:26.0 - 12:30.0] offset by continued softness in our industrial business.
[12:30.0 - 12:34.0] In our CCS segment, we anticipate revenue in our communications end market
[12:34.0 - 12:36.0] to be up in the high 50s percentage range,
[12:36.0 - 12:39.0] driven by continued demand strength for our networking switches,
[12:39.0 - 12:43.0] including accelerating ramps in our 800G program.
[12:43.0 - 12:44.0] In our enterprise end market,
[12:44.0 - 12:48.0] we expect revenues to decrease in the low double-digit percentage range.
[12:48.0 - 12:50.0] Consistent with our commentary last quarter,
[12:50.0 - 12:53.0] the anticipated decline is driven by a technology transition
[12:53.0 - 12:56.0] in a large sole-sourced AI ML compute program,
[12:56.0 - 12:59.0] with the next generation program, also sole-sourced,
[12:59.0 - 13:02.0] expected to ramp in the latter half of 2025.
[13:02.0 - 13:08.0] We expect these declines will be partly offset by growth in our storage business.
[13:08.0 - 13:11.0] Assuming the achievement of the midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance ranges,
[13:11.0 - 13:14.0] we now anticipate revenue of $9.6 billion
[13:14.0 - 13:19.0] and adjusted EPS of $3.85 for the full year 2024.
[13:19.0 - 13:21.0] If these outlooks are achieved,
[13:21.0 - 13:26.0] they would represent growth of 21% and 58% respectively.
[13:26.0 - 13:32.0] Our 2024 non-IFRS operating margin is now expected to be 6.5%,
[13:32.0 - 13:36.0] which would represent a 90 basis points improvement.
[13:36.0 - 13:41.0] Finally, our adjusted free cash flow is now expected to be $275 million for the full year,
[13:41.0 - 13:46.0] up from our previous outlook of $250 million.
[13:46.0 - 13:49.0] I'd also like to take this opportunity to remind everyone of our upcoming transition
[13:49.0 - 13:53.0] from foreign private issuer to U.S. domestic issuer reporting status,
[13:53.0 - 13:57.0] as our shareholder base is now comprised of a majority of U.S.-based investors.
[13:57.0 - 14:00.0] Beginning January the 1st, 2025,
[14:00.0 - 14:03.0] our consolidated financial statements will be prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP,
[14:03.0 - 14:07.0] and we will no longer report results under IFRS.
[14:07.0 - 14:11.0] Concurrent with the release of our Q4 and full year 2024 financial results,
[14:11.0 - 14:14.0] we will include a reconciliation of the financial metrics provided
[14:14.0 - 14:18.0] as part of our guidance and outlook in IFRS and non-IFRS
[14:18.0 - 14:23.0] for the comparable U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted financial metrics.
[14:23.0 - 14:28.0] At this time, we do not expect any material differences in our Q4 2024 guidance
[14:28.0 - 14:32.0] and full year 2024 outlook, had it been prepared under U.S. GAAP.
[14:32.0 - 14:37.0] Finally, this change does not impact our status as a Canadian domiciled company.
[14:37.0 - 14:40.0] With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Rob
[14:40.0 - 14:44.0] to begin our 2024 virtual investor meeting.
[14:44.0 - 14:46.0] Thank you, Mandeep.
[14:46.0 - 14:49.0] We're excited to have the opportunity to provide you with an update
[14:49.0 - 14:52.0] on the progress we have been making in the execution of our strategy
[14:52.0 - 14:57.0] and an overview of the opportunities we are pursuing in each of our markets.
[14:57.0 - 15:00.0] Before we get started, I'd like to briefly walk you through the agenda
[15:00.0 - 15:03.0] for the next portion of our call today.
[15:03.0 - 15:07.0] First, I will provide a brief overview of our business, our operational footprint,
[15:07.0 - 15:11.0] and discuss the key pillars of our company's strategy.
[15:11.0 - 15:16.0] Next, Jason Phillips, President of Connectivity and Cloud Solutions,
[15:16.0 - 15:18.0] will provide an overview of our CCS segment
[15:18.0 - 15:22.0] and discuss the evolving data center and IT hardware landscape.
[15:22.0 - 15:27.0] Following Jason, Todd Cooper, President of Advanced Technology Solutions,
[15:27.0 - 15:31.0] will discuss our diversified markets portfolio, including the macro outlook
[15:31.0 - 15:35.0] and long-term strategic priorities across each of our end markets.
[15:35.0 - 15:39.0] And finally, we will hand the floor back to our CFO, Mandeep Chawla,
[15:39.0 - 15:44.0] who will discuss our 2025 financial outlook, our capital allocation priorities,
[15:44.0 - 15:48.0] and our plans to continue to maximize returns for our shareholders.
[15:48.0 - 15:51.0] Following this, we will open up the lines for Q&A,
[15:51.0 - 15:55.0] where Steve Dorward, SVP of our hyperscaler and service provider business,
[15:55.0 - 15:58.0] will also join us.
[15:58.0 - 16:02.0] Now let's begin with an overview of our business today.
[16:02.0 - 16:05.0] Telestica is a global leader in electronic manufacturing services
[16:05.0 - 16:09.0] and supply chain solutions, serving the world's leading technology companies
[16:09.0 - 16:15.0] across a range of industries which are critical to the advancement of a global economy.
[16:15.0 - 16:17.0] We're much more than just a manufacturing partner.
[16:17.0 - 16:21.0] We're a strategic collaborator, offering leading-edge products,
[16:21.0 - 16:23.0] best-in-class engineering support,

[16:32.0 - 16:37.0] We enable our customers to bring innovative products and services to market with speed,
[16:37.0 - 16:41.0] efficiency, and uncompromising quality.
[16:41.0 - 16:46.0] The evolution in our business continues to be reflected in our financial performance.
[16:46.0 - 16:51.0] Our consistently improving results in recent years have been driven by the successful
[16:51.0 - 16:55.0] execution of our strategy and the growing demand for our leading capabilities
[16:55.0 - 16:57.0] and product offerings.
[16:57.0 - 17:04.0] Achievement of our full-year outlook for 2024 would represent the strongest non-IFRS operating margins
[17:04.0 - 17:10.0] and the highest adjusted earnings per share in the company's history.
[17:10.0 - 17:15.0] Today, Telestica's strengths extend far beyond traditional EMS.
[17:15.0 - 17:21.0] We believe that our differentiated value proposition leverages the best of both the EMS
[17:21.0 - 17:29.0] and ODM models, combining our scale and supply chain proficiency with advanced customization capabilities
[17:29.0 - 17:32.0] in both design and manufacturing.
[17:32.0 - 17:38.0] We believe that as a North American-based Tier 1 EMS and ODM company,
[17:38.0 - 17:41.0] our offering stands out amongst our competitors in the marketplace.
[17:41.0 - 17:49.0] And importantly, it offers us a number of distinct strategic advantages that allow us to better serve our customers
[17:49.0 - 17:55.0] and positions us as a choice partner for complex, high-reliability programs.
[17:55.0 - 18:01.0] Our strategic plan is built on four key pillars, which are intended to leverage our core strengths
[18:01.0 - 18:05.0] and capitalize on market opportunities that align with our competencies,
[18:05.0 - 18:08.0] while delivering sustainable value to our shareholders.
[18:08.0 - 18:14.0] Firstly, we're committed to building a resilient, growth-oriented, and diversified portfolio,
[18:14.0 - 18:17.0] designed to withstand cyclical fluctuations.
[18:17.0 - 18:20.0] We've been discerning in choosing the markets that we compete in,
[18:20.0 - 18:24.0] and we remain selective in our approach to entering new markets.
[18:24.0 - 18:30.0] Our focus remains on opportunities that we believe are supported by strong secular tailwinds,
[18:30.0 - 18:35.0] offer attractive growth potential, and provide structural benefits to our portfolio.
[18:35.0 - 18:40.0] Secondly, we're committed to making the necessary investments to expand our capabilities
[18:40.0 - 18:42.0] and further enhance our offerings.
[18:42.0 - 18:48.0] While we have made a great deal of progress in this regard over the years, we are not resting on our past achievements.
[18:48.0 - 18:55.0] We continue to build out our ODM offering with investments in next-generation products based on multi-year roadmaps,
[18:55.0 - 19:00.0] while adding to and enhancing our EMS engineering and services capabilities.
[19:00.0 - 19:06.0] Thirdly, we remain dedicated to operational excellence across our global footprint.
[19:06.0 - 19:11.0] The Celestica operating system is designed to help ensure consistency in our operational execution
[19:11.0 - 19:16.0] and to enable best-in-class performance, which is reflected by the numerous customer awards
[19:16.0 - 19:21.0] and high customer scorecard ratings that we receive each year.
[19:21.0 - 19:24.0] Quality and execution are central to our ethos.
[19:23.7 - 19:26.8] and integral to everything that we do.
[19:26.8 - 19:29.9] Lastly, our objective is to maximize
[19:29.9 - 19:31.5] total shareholder returns.
[19:31.5 - 19:33.1] We aim to achieve this by targeting
[19:33.1 - 19:36.6] long-term adjusted EPS growth of 10% or more
[19:36.6 - 19:38.4] while maintaining a disciplined approach
[19:38.4 - 19:41.6] to capital allocation.
[19:41.6 - 19:43.9] Now I would like to hand the call over to Jason Phillips
[19:43.9 - 19:46.9] to provide a closer look at our CCS segment.
[19:46.9 - 19:49.8] Jason, over to you.
[19:49.8 - 19:52.1] Thank you, Rob, and good evening, everyone.
[19:52.3 - 19:54.0] I'm pleased to be here with you today
[19:54.0 - 19:56.5] to provide an update on some of the exciting projects
[19:56.5 - 19:58.3] we are working on in our connectivity
[19:58.3 - 20:00.4] in cloud solutions business.
[20:00.4 - 20:03.4] I'd like to start with a look at where we are today.
[20:03.4 - 20:05.7] 2024 has been a year of tremendous growth
[20:05.7 - 20:07.5] for our business as we are on track
[20:07.5 - 20:10.8] to achieve $6.4 billion in revenue,
[20:10.8 - 20:15.2] which would represent an impressive 39% increase.
[20:15.2 - 20:17.0] Our growth has been driven by strong demand
[20:17.0 - 20:19.1] in all three of our core technologies,
[20:19.1 - 20:21.6] server and storage in our enterprise and market,
[20:21.7 - 20:24.3] and networking within our communications end market,
[20:24.3 - 20:26.5] with each category expected to end the year
[20:26.5 - 20:28.9] up more than 25%.
[20:28.9 - 20:30.5] We'll talk more about our portfolio
[20:30.5 - 20:33.9] in each of those technologies in just a few minutes.
[20:33.9 - 20:35.3] From a customer perspective,
[20:35.3 - 20:37.5] hyperscalers have been the primary growth driver
[20:37.5 - 20:39.5] in our business this year.
[20:39.5 - 20:44.0] In 2024, we are on track for $4.8 billion in revenue
[20:44.0 - 20:46.1] with hyperscalers, which now accounts
[20:46.1 - 20:50.1] for nearly three-quarters of our CCS portfolio.
[20:50.1 - 20:52.7] Looking at our CCS segment by solution,
[20:52.7 - 20:55.3] we've seen in recent years strong and balanced growth
[20:55.3 - 20:59.2] across both our EMS and HPS portfolios.
[20:59.2 - 21:01.2] Our HPS business continues to account
[21:01.2 - 21:03.7] for a rising share of our portfolio,
[21:03.7 - 21:05.7] driven by strong demand in our market-leading
[21:05.7 - 21:07.3] Ethernet switch business.
[21:08.8 - 21:10.8] Lastly, we are supporting our customers
[21:10.8 - 21:12.5] by continuing to make investments
[21:12.5 - 21:14.4] in our services capabilities,
[21:14.4 - 21:16.6] which we view as an increasingly important part
[21:16.6 - 21:19.3] of our end-to-end lifecycle solutions offering
[21:19.3 - 21:21.1] for the data center.
[21:21.1 - 21:24.3] Adding to our core strengths in R&D and engineering,
[21:24.3 - 21:25.8] our services offering has grown
[21:25.8 - 21:28.2] to include IT asset disposition,
[21:28.2 - 21:31.8] IT asset management, and carbon credit services,
[21:31.8 - 21:35.3] creating a powerful platform for growth with our customers
[21:35.3 - 21:37.2] by helping to strengthen our relationships
[21:37.2 - 21:38.8] and drive higher attach rates.
[21:40.5 - 21:42.1] As we look at the major market trends
[21:42.1 - 21:43.6] influencing our business,
[21:43.6 - 21:45.4] investments in artificial intelligence
[21:45.4 - 21:47.8] continue to be the driving force
[21:47.8 - 21:50.2] shaping the data center landscape.
[21:50.2 - 21:53.1] It remains our belief that the current wave of investment
[21:53.1 - 21:56.8] in AI infrastructure has a multi-year runway ahead of it.
[21:58.1 - 22:00.2] Today, the lion's share of the investment
[22:00.2 - 22:04.2] in AI infrastructure is driven by the top five hyperscalers,
[22:04.2 - 22:08.3] who are estimated to spend $133 billion this year
[22:08.3 - 22:10.8] on data center hardware across storage,
[22:10.8 - 22:13.8] networking, and server technologies.
[22:13.8 - 22:16.4] Estimates suggest that annual hyperscalers spend
[22:16.4 - 22:18.3] on data center hardware will grow
[22:18.3 - 22:21.5] by more than $50 billion through 2027,
[22:21.5 - 22:25.8] or 40% to $186 billion.
[22:25.8 - 22:27.9] The latest forecasts based on discussions
[22:27.9 - 22:30.1] with our customers for 2025
[22:30.1 - 22:32.4] are showing early support for these estimates.
[22:33.5 - 22:35.8] Today, we serve our hyperscaler customers
[22:35.8 - 22:39.1] across all three major hardware technology categories,
[22:39.1 - 22:41.4] and we are investing to stay at the leading edge
[22:41.4 - 22:43.1] of the technology curve.
[22:43.1 - 22:46.1] As we look ahead, we feel we are well-positioned
[22:46.8 - 22:49.1] to continue to capture a growing share of the spend
[22:49.1 - 22:51.3] from these key players in the coming years.
[22:53.2 - 22:56.0] As we've seen, the hardware and infrastructure investments
[22:56.0 - 22:58.4] required to support the development of AI models
[22:58.4 - 23:00.2] are significant.
[23:00.2 - 23:01.9] And while hyperscalers are leading
[23:01.9 - 23:04.1] the AI investment cycle today,
[23:04.1 - 23:06.6] there is a growing wave of organizations,
[23:06.6 - 23:09.7] which the market has termed digital native companies,
[23:09.7 - 23:12.1] who are looking to harness the transformative potential
[23:12.1 - 23:15.6] of AI by ramping up their own infrastructure investments.
[23:16.8 - 23:18.3] We believe that these emerging players
[23:18.3 - 23:20.9] in the rapidly expanding AI ecosystem
[23:20.9 - 23:24.5] present high margin growth opportunities of meaningful scale
[23:24.5 - 23:26.7] for solutions providers like Celestica.
[23:28.8 - 23:30.7] Firstly, we are seeing opportunities
[23:30.7 - 23:34.6] with an emerging breed of specialized AI cloud providers,
[23:34.6 - 23:37.7] providing AI optimized infrastructure and services
[23:37.7 - 23:40.8] to support increasingly specific use cases,
[23:40.8 - 23:42.9] such as natural language processing,
[23:42.9 - 23:45.9] machine vision, and data analytics.
[23:46.6 - 23:47.7] Others in this market are building
[23:47.7 - 23:50.3] high-powered AI compute infrastructure at scale,
[23:50.3 - 23:52.5] helping customers to scale their AI workloads
[23:52.5 - 23:55.3] more efficiently and at a lower cost.
[23:57.0 - 23:59.0] Next, as large enterprise customers
[23:59.0 - 24:01.9] increasingly employ the use of AI models,
[24:01.9 - 24:04.5] we anticipate more spending on edge computing,
[24:04.5 - 24:08.1] bringing AI infrastructure closer to where data is created
[24:08.1 - 24:11.2] in order to reduce latency and enhance data security.
[24:12.5 - 24:15.3] Finally, we have seen a number of nations or sovereigns
[24:15.4 - 24:16.6] make commitments to invest
[24:16.6 - 24:18.9] in large-scale data center projects,
[24:18.9 - 24:20.4] as governments across the world
[24:20.4 - 24:23.4] are increasingly recognizing the strategic importance
[24:23.4 - 24:26.0] of domestic AI infrastructure.
[24:26.0 - 24:27.6] These government-led initiatives
[24:27.6 - 24:31.2] could be a meaningful contributor to growth in CapEx dollars
[24:31.2 - 24:33.4] within the AI data center ecosystem.
[24:34.4 - 24:36.7] We believe Celestica is well-positioned
[24:36.7 - 24:39.6] to capitalize on these emerging opportunities.
[24:39.6 - 24:41.0] Our expertise in designing
[24:41.0 - 24:43.8] and manufacturing advanced hardware solutions,
[24:43.8 - 24:46.7] coupled with our comprehensive services portfolio,
[24:46.7 - 24:48.3] enables us to cater to the needs
[24:48.3 - 24:50.2] of this diverse set of customers.
[24:51.9 - 24:54.5] Hardware Platform Solutions, or HPS,
[24:54.5 - 24:58.1] is Celestica's original design manufacturing offering,
[24:58.1 - 24:59.7] where we innovate on product designs
[24:59.7 - 25:02.7] across all three major technologies in the data center,
[25:02.7 - 25:05.3] server, storage, and networking.
[25:05.3 - 25:08.0] Our HPS business supports our customers on engagements,
[25:08.0 - 25:12.0] ranging from joint design to highly customized hardware,
[25:12.0 - 25:14.3] to off-the-shelf white-box solutions,
[25:14.3 - 25:17.1] which can be further enabled with open-source software.
[25:18.8 - 25:22.0] In 2024, we anticipate that HPS will generate
[25:22.0 - 25:25.3] approximately $2.8 billion in revenues,
[25:25.3 - 25:28.9] which would represent growth of more than 60%.
[25:28.9 - 25:33.4] However, this journey has been far from an overnight success.
[25:33.4 - 25:36.2] We've spent more than 10 years building our platform
[25:36.2 - 25:38.0] while innovating hundreds of patents
[25:38.0 - 25:41.8] and supporting 230 product launches.
[25:42.5 - 25:44.7] This year, we will be investing nearly $80 million
[25:44.7 - 25:48.9] into R&D, and we expect that number to grow next year.
[25:51.2 - 25:54.4] R&D is a core competency for Celestica.
[25:54.4 - 25:55.6] In addition to innovating
[25:55.6 - 25:58.2] with our own proprietary product designs,
[25:58.2 - 25:59.7] we also play an important role
[25:59.7 - 26:03.1] as an extension of our customers' R&D teams.
[26:03.1 - 26:04.6] We believe that our capabilities
[26:04.6 - 26:06.7] and breadth of offerings in this area
[26:06.7 - 26:09.4] are a critical factor that differentiates us
[26:09.4 - 26:12.9] from both our North American EMS and ODM peers.
[26:14.4 - 26:17.6] Our investments over the last decade-plus in this platform
[26:17.6 - 26:20.5] reflect our strong commitment to making ODM
[26:20.5 - 26:23.9] a central and enduring element of our business.
[26:23.9 - 26:27.9] Our HPS portfolio is margin-accretive to our CCS segment
[26:27.9 - 26:30.5] and enables relationships that are more deeply entrenched
[26:30.5 - 26:33.2] with our customers and ecosystem partners
[26:33.2 - 26:35.6] compared to traditional EMS engagements.
[26:37.1 - 26:38.8] In networking, our Switch products
[26:39.1 - 26:41.2] support a range of customers and use cases,
[26:41.2 - 26:44.9] from 1G switches for OEMs designed for the campus
[26:44.9 - 26:47.4] to 800G switches for hyperscalers
[26:47.4 - 26:51.0] used to facilitate AI workloads in the data center.
[26:51.0 - 26:53.7] Today, the majority of our HPS portfolio
[26:53.7 - 26:56.0] is made up of networking switches,
[26:56.0 - 26:59.1] which are exclusively for Ethernet.
[26:59.1 - 27:01.2] We were an early leader in 400G,
[27:01.2 - 27:03.6] and we are early to market with our 800G solutions,
[27:03.6 - 27:05.9] which are being well-received by our customers.
[27:05.9 - 27:08.2] In preparation for the next upgrade cycle,
[27:08.2 - 27:11.2] we are already investing in designs for 1.6T.
[27:12.4 - 27:16.6] Our growing team of nearly 150 software engineers in Chennai
[27:16.6 - 27:18.0] continues to support customers
[27:18.0 - 27:21.4] with enablement of proprietary open-source solutions
[27:21.4 - 27:23.4] for network operating systems,
[27:23.4 - 27:24.5] which we believe customers
[27:24.5 - 27:27.4] will continue to gravitate to over time.
[27:27.4 - 27:28.7] We also have the capability
[27:28.7 - 27:31.4] to offer a ready-to-use operating system,
[27:31.4 - 27:33.8] production-hardened by our engineering team,
[27:33.8 - 27:36.8] or to integrate existing third-party software
[27:36.8 - 27:38.8] and optimize performance for each.
[27:40.2 - 27:41.7] In AI ML Compute,
[27:41.7 - 27:44.6] we are committing R&D to advanced cooling system designs
[27:44.6 - 27:47.9] to support the increasing power demands of AI Silicon,
[27:47.9 - 27:50.2] which we'll talk more about in a few minutes.
[27:51.2 - 27:52.1] And in storage,
[27:52.1 - 27:54.9] we have proprietary designs for high availability,
[27:54.9 - 27:57.9] next-generation controllers, and expansion systems,
[27:57.9 - 28:00.0] which we are able to integrate with our offering
[28:00.0 - 28:01.8] as part of our RAC solutions.
[28:02.7 - 28:05.1] We feel that our distinctive ODM offering
[28:05.1 - 28:07.3] will continue to drive new wins
[28:07.3 - 28:09.0] and remain a key growth driver
[28:09.0 - 28:11.3] in our CCS segment over the long-term.
[28:13.0 - 28:14.9] Next, I'd like to do a deeper dive
[28:14.9 - 28:16.6] into our business and the market outlook
[28:16.6 - 28:19.3] across each of our technologies.
[28:19.3 - 28:21.0] Celestica's communications business
[28:21.0 - 28:23.1] is a cornerstone of our portfolio.
[28:24.2 - 28:27.6] Today, Celestica is the world's largest ODM provider
[28:27.6 - 28:29.0] of Ethernet switches,
[28:29.0 - 28:31.8] with $2.4 billion of our portfolio
[28:31.8 - 28:36.4] expected to come from HPS Networking Solutions in 2024.
[28:36.4 - 28:39.5] Our portfolio is geared towards high-bandwidth applications
[28:39.5 - 28:41.9] with the majority of our HPS Networking revenues
[28:41.9 - 28:45.0] now coming from switches 400G and higher.
[28:46.3 - 28:48.1] Our focus on high-bandwidth solutions
[28:48.1 - 28:50.0] is reflected in our leading market share
[28:50.0 - 28:52.5] in the 400G switch segment.
[28:52.5 - 28:53.8] Third-party data suggests
[28:53.8 - 28:56.3] that we have the market's largest install base
[28:56.3 - 28:59.1] as measured by deliveries of 400G ports
[28:59.1 - 29:00.8] over the past five years.
[29:02.0 - 29:03.5] As leading data center operators
[29:03.5 - 29:06.1] begin their transition to 800G,
[29:06.1 - 29:08.9] we will be enabling all of our hyperscaler customers
[29:08.9 - 29:12.5] to use our 400G switches in the separate cycle.
[29:12.5 - 29:14.4] We believe that being early to market
[29:14.4 - 29:16.2] with our 800G solutions
[29:16.2 - 29:19.3] has us poised to build on our existing leadership position
[29:19.3 - 29:20.5] as ramps accelerate.
[29:21.8 - 29:24.2] The rapid expansion of cloud data centers,
[29:24.2 - 29:25.5] coupled with the increasing demand
[29:25.5 - 29:28.8] for more powerful computing to support AI applications,
[29:28.8 - 29:31.2] is driving exceptional levels of investment
[29:31.3 - 29:33.5] in networking infrastructure.
[29:33.5 - 29:36.2] Market forecasts predict that the Ethernet switch market
[29:36.2 - 29:39.2] for bandwidth of 400G and higher
[29:39.2 - 29:43.9] will grow at a remarkable 52% compound annual growth rate
[29:43.9 - 29:45.8] over the next three years.
[29:46.7 - 29:48.2] It is critical to our success
[29:48.2 - 29:50.4] to continue to be a first mover
[29:50.4 - 29:51.6] and remain at the leading edge
[29:51.6 - 29:54.3] of each successive technology transition,
[29:54.3 - 29:57.6] and we are making the necessary investments to do so.
[29:57.6 - 30:00.5] To this end, we're pleased to have an initial win
[30:00.5 - 30:02.8] with a large hyperscaler customer
[30:02.8 - 30:05.7] for a 1.6 terabyte switching program,
[30:05.7 - 30:09.0] exemplifying our leadership and innovation.
[30:09.0 - 30:11.3] We anticipate that this win will be the first of many
[30:11.3 - 30:13.9] for the next generation in switching technology
[30:13.9 - 30:16.0] and expect to see revenues from this program
[30:16.0 - 30:18.7] begin ramping in mid-2026.
[30:19.9 - 30:22.4] With each generation of upgrades to higher bandwidths,
[30:22.4 - 30:25.0] the engineering challenges related to signal integrity,
[30:25.0 - 30:26.7] power and thermal management
[30:26.7 - 30:28.8] involve a step function increase in complexity
[30:28.8 - 30:30.8] relative to previous generations,
[30:30.8 - 30:33.2] making a high-performance product that is early to market
[30:33.2 - 30:35.1] that much more challenging to deliver.
[30:36.6 - 30:38.1] This is a dynamic that we believe
[30:38.1 - 30:40.1] plays to Celestica's strengths in R&D,
[30:40.1 - 30:42.4] and we are confident we are up to the task.

[38:22.4 - 38:25.8] by achieving an anticipated 11% average annual
[38:25.8 - 38:28.7] revenue growth rate over the past three years.
[38:28.7 - 38:31.1] This speaks to the attractiveness and durability
[38:31.1 - 38:34.6] of our ATS portfolio over the longterm.
[38:34.6 - 38:38.2] In 2025, we expect to see our ATS segment revenues
[38:38.2 - 38:41.3] grow in the low single digits percentage range.
[38:41.3 - 38:43.2] We will discuss the end market dynamics
[38:43.2 - 38:45.6] driving this growth shortly.
[38:45.6 - 38:47.6] Overall, our strategic priority.
[38:47.4 - 38:50.0] for the ATS segment is to achieve greater scale
[38:50.0 - 38:51.9] in select markets in an effort
[38:51.9 - 38:55.2] to drive a more optimal mix within our portfolio.
[38:55.2 - 38:57.0] Attaining this balance will allow us
[38:57.0 - 38:59.7] to reap greater benefits of diversification,
[38:59.7 - 39:01.2] reduce volatility,
[39:01.2 - 39:05.0] and better weather cyclical market downturns.
[39:05.0 - 39:06.9] We are optimistic about the growth roadmaps
[39:06.9 - 39:09.3] that we have laid out for each of our ATS businesses
[39:09.3 - 39:11.2] and continue to have confidence in our ability
[39:11.2 - 39:14.1] to maintain our long-term target revenue growth rate
[39:14.1 - 39:18.3] of 10% or more for the ATS portfolio.
[39:18.3 - 39:20.2] Now let's move on and discuss the outlook
[39:20.2 - 39:23.1] and growth opportunities in each of our end markets,
[39:23.1 - 39:25.8] starting with industrial and smart energy.
[39:25.8 - 39:28.2] Our industrial and smart energy portfolio,
[39:28.2 - 39:30.6] which is expected to achieve $1.3 billion
[39:30.6 - 39:31.9] in revenue this year,

[40:02.2 - 40:03.7] working with new technologies.
[40:04.6 - 40:07.9] After a year of soft demand driven by macro uncertainties
[40:07.9 - 40:09.9] and customer inventory burndown,
[40:09.9 - 40:12.6] we are seeing signs of market stabilization.
[40:12.6 - 40:14.6] We remain cautiously optimistic
[40:14.6 - 40:17.2] on returning to growth in 2025,
[40:17.2 - 40:19.2] with demand expected to strengthen
[40:19.2 - 40:21.4] in the back half of next year.
[40:21.4 - 40:22.7] Over the long-term,
[40:22.7 - 40:25.5] we continue to see many attractive opportunities
[40:25.5 - 40:28.4] supported by favorable trends in the sub-markets.
[40:28.4 - 40:30.6] In fact, industry forecasts suggest
[40:30.6 - 40:33.3] that base demand in our smart energy markets,
[40:33.3 - 40:35.7] including EV charging, energy storage,
[40:35.7 - 40:37.2] and energy generation,
[40:37.2 - 40:40.1] are expected to grow at an average of 13% annually
[40:40.1 - 40:41.7] through 2027,
[40:41.7 - 40:44.8] driven by government spending on green energy infrastructure
[40:44.8 - 40:48.3] and supported by bills such as the Inflation Reduction Act.
[40:48.3 - 40:50.5] We are also seeing solid opportunities
[40:50.5 - 40:53.2] in battery energy storage systems,
[40:53.2 - 40:57.7] supporting both utility-scale and residential applications.
[40:57.7 - 40:59.2] Let's move on to AMD.
[40:59.2 - 41:00.9] Today, our AMD business is comprised
[41:00.9 - 41:05.2] of approximately 60% commercial aerospace and 40% defense,
[41:05.2 - 41:06.7] and is on track to reach approximately
[41:06.7 - 41:09.9] 900 million of revenue in 2024.
[41:09.9 - 41:14.1] We serve major aircraft, subsystem, and component OEMs,
[41:14.1 - 41:16.2] as well as defense contractors from our sites
[41:16.2 - 41:19.5] in Malaysia, Europe, and North America.
[41:19.5 - 41:22.1] We view ourselves as the leading AMD supplier
[41:22.1 - 41:23.7] within the EMS industry,
[41:23.7 - 41:25.5] supported by over two decades
[41:25.5 - 41:27.4] of developing our key capabilities
[41:27.4 - 41:29.8] and proof points with our customers.
[41:29.8 - 41:31.5] Breaking it down by segment,
[41:31.5 - 41:32.9] in commercial aerospace,
[41:32.9 - 41:35.4] the general demand backdrop remains stable,
[41:35.4 - 41:38.5] with growth in our base business expected to normalize
[41:38.5 - 41:41.2] after several strong years of being bolstered
[41:41.2 - 41:43.4] by recovery from the pandemic.
[41:43.4 - 41:46.3] Looking at our commercial portfolio in 2025,
[41:46.3 - 41:49.6] we have made the decision not to renew an expiring program
[41:49.6 - 41:51.8] that is breaking even in profitability.
[41:51.8 - 41:53.0] At the same time,
[41:53.0 - 41:55.6] we have recently won a high-margin licensing program
[41:55.6 - 41:57.3] with this same customer.
[41:57.3 - 41:59.5] As a result, in 2025,
[41:59.5 - 42:01.9] we expect AMD revenue to be approximately
[42:01.9 - 42:04.5] $100 million lower year over year,
[42:04.5 - 42:09.5] but with higher operating profit dollars and margins.
[42:09.5 - 42:12.0] In defense, we are seeing strong traction
[42:12.0 - 42:14.1] with new opportunities driven by demand
[42:14.1 - 42:16.5] from European and Western governments,
[42:16.5 - 42:19.3] which are expected to drive robust growth.
[42:19.3 - 42:21.5] We are also leveraging our engineering capabilities

[42:32.0 - 42:34.2] Let's next move to capital equipment.
[42:34.2 - 42:37.3] After a challenging 2020-30 in capital equipment,
[42:37.3 - 42:39.3] we have seen demand begin to recover,
[42:39.3 - 42:41.9] and we expect revenues of approximately $700 million
[42:41.9 - 42:45.0] in 2024, up 16%.
[42:45.0 - 42:46.6] Our capital equipment of business
[42:46.6 - 42:47.8] supports the world's leading
[42:47.8 - 42:50.4] wafer fabrication equipment OEMs
[42:50.4 - 42:52.7] through our network of sites in Malaysia,
[42:52.7 - 42:55.2] South Korea, and the U.S.
[42:55.2 - 42:57.5] We believe that our extensive capabilities
[42:57.5 - 42:59.2] and depth of experience
[42:59.2 - 43:02.7] position us as a leading EMS provider in this market.
[43:02.7 - 43:04.7] This is evidenced by our strong share gains
[43:04.7 - 43:06.1] over the past several years,
[43:06.1 - 43:08.9] including our newest logo, ASML Holdings,
[43:08.9 - 43:10.1] with whom we have begun
[43:10.1 - 43:13.1] ramping critical lithography programs.
[43:13.1 - 43:15.8] In 2025, we expect growth to be supported
[43:15.8 - 43:18.2] by these ramping programs in lithography,
[43:18.2 - 43:21.5] as well as continued recovery in base market demand
[43:21.5 - 43:23.7] driven primarily by memory.
[43:23.7 - 43:25.8] Further, we continue to make investments
[43:25.8 - 43:27.9] in our footprint and capabilities
[43:27.9 - 43:29.4] to better service our customers
[43:29.4 - 43:32.3] on leading edge technologies in memory,
[43:32.3 - 43:36.0] logic, lithography, and AI devices.
[43:36.0 - 43:38.1] We've added new clean room capacity
[43:38.1 - 43:39.3] over the last 12 months
[43:39.3 - 43:41.7] in all of our capital equipment sites globally,
[43:41.7 - 43:44.1] as well as additional technical personnel
[43:44.1 - 43:48.5] to support demand for both domestic U.S. and Asia production.
[43:48.5 - 43:50.6] We believe that our domestic capacity
[43:50.6 - 43:52.6] and strategic footprint within Asia
[43:52.6 - 43:55.2] will be critical differentiators in the years ahead,
[43:55.2 - 43:57.9] as geopolitical considerations,
[43:57.9 - 43:59.2] increasing government restrictions
[43:59.2 - 44:01.4] on the semiconductor industry,
[44:01.4 - 44:05.1] and the need for localization continue to intensify.
[44:05.1 - 44:07.5] And finally, let's move to our health tech business.
[44:07.5 - 44:08.6] In our health tech business,
[44:08.6 - 44:10.2] we anticipate revenues of approximately
[44:10.2 - 44:12.8] 300 million in 2024.
[44:12.8 - 44:14.0] Today, we serve customers
[44:14.0 - 44:16.2] across a number of critical technologies,
[44:16.2 - 44:19.3] leveraging our high reliability manufacturing capabilities
[44:19.3 - 44:22.9] at FDA registered and ISO certified facilities.
[44:22.9 - 44:24.9] Looking ahead to 2025,
[44:25.0 - 44:27.3] our business is expected to see modest growth
[44:27.3 - 44:28.9] as we ramp new programs
[44:28.9 - 44:32.2] and shift our mix towards finished devices
[44:32.2 - 44:33.4] while continuing to expand
[44:33.4 - 44:36.2] our health tech engineering services offerings.
[44:36.2 - 44:38.1] Our long-term growth plans in health tech
[44:38.1 - 44:41.6] are primarily focused on the fast growing diabetes care,
[44:41.6 - 44:45.5] imaging, diagnostics, and surgical instrument markets.
[44:45.5 - 44:46.8] To support this growth,
[44:46.8 - 44:47.9] we have made investments
[44:47.9 - 44:50.6] in our product level engineering capabilities,
[44:50.6 - 44:53.9] enabling us to support our customers end to end
[44:53.9 - 44:56.4] from full box filled to finished products,
[44:56.4 - 44:59.3] to testing and regulatory certification.
[44:59.3 - 45:01.0] We also continue to invest
[45:01.0 - 45:03.5] in our advanced manufacturing competence,
[45:03.5 - 45:06.9] most recently adding to our automation capabilities
[45:06.9 - 45:09.4] at our Galway, Ireland site.
[45:09.4 - 45:11.4] With that, I would now like to turn the floor
[45:11.4 - 45:12.8] back over to Mandeep,
[45:12.8 - 45:15.6] who will discuss our financial outlook for 2025
[45:15.6 - 45:17.7] and our capital allocation priorities.
[45:19.9 - 45:21.1] Thank you, Todd.
[45:21.1 - 45:23.6] Since completing our strategic transformation in 2020,
[45:24.2 - 45:25.7] Alaska has made significant progress
[45:25.7 - 45:26.9] on our path towards achieving
[45:26.9 - 45:29.7] the level of financial performance we have in 2024,
[45:29.7 - 45:31.2] which as Rob mentioned,
[45:31.2 - 45:33.8] is on track to be another record year.
[45:33.8 - 45:35.8] A look back at the past five years
[45:35.8 - 45:38.7] showcases our track record of consistent growth
[45:38.7 - 45:40.4] and improvements in profitability.
[45:41.4 - 45:43.6] Assuming the achievement of our 2024 outlook,
[45:43.6 - 45:46.5] we will have added nearly $4 billion in revenue
[45:46.5 - 45:47.8] over the last four years,
[45:47.8 - 45:51.8] amounting to a 14% CAGR since 2020.
[45:51.8 - 45:53.1] With $4.6 billion in revenue,
[45:53.1 - 45:56.5] we are on track to close 2024 up 21%
[45:56.5 - 45:57.8] during a period where the majority
[45:57.8 - 46:00.6] of our EMS industry peers are seeing revenue decline.
[46:01.9 - 46:04.1] Profitability also continues to improve
[46:04.1 - 46:05.7] as our portfolio's mix has shifted
[46:05.7 - 46:07.8] towards higher margin ODM business
[46:07.8 - 46:11.3] and high complexity engagement in our CCS segment.
[46:11.3 - 46:13.7] Our outlook for 2024, if achieved,
[46:13.7 - 46:15.9] will have seen non-IFRS operating margins
[46:15.9 - 46:18.1] rise by 300 basis points
[46:18.1 - 46:21.9] and adjusted EPS nearly four times higher compared to 2020.
[46:23.1 - 46:26.6] Our ability to efficiently manage our working capital
[46:26.6 - 46:28.5] during this period of strong growth
[46:28.5 - 46:31.0] has seen us generate positive adjusted pre-tax flow
[46:31.0 - 46:33.2] in each quarter for over five years.
[46:34.1 - 46:35.4] We believe our performance speaks
[46:35.4 - 46:37.3] to our disciplined financial strategy,
[46:37.3 - 46:40.1] the resilience of our portfolio across both of our segments
[46:40.1 - 46:41.5] and the strength of our team.
[46:43.0 - 46:45.7] Looking ahead at our early estimates for 2025,
[46:46.7 - 46:49.4] we anticipate revenue of $10.4 billion,
[46:49.4 - 46:51.4] which would represent growth of 8%
[46:51.4 - 46:53.9] compared to our 2024 outlook.
[46:53.9 - 46:55.8] Our CCS segment is expected to see growth
[46:55.8 - 46:57.9] in the low double-digit percentage range
[46:57.9 - 47:00.2] driven primarily by the ramping of 100G programs
[47:00.2 - 47:03.7] with hyperscalers and new wins in AI ML compute.
[47:04.9 - 47:06.2] In our ATS segment,
[47:06.2 - 47:08.7] we anticipate low single-digit percentage growth
[47:08.7 - 47:11.1] as our industrial and capital equipment businesses
[47:11.1 - 47:13.5] are expected to experience a recovery in demand,
[47:13.5 - 47:16.6] partly offset by lower revenues in our AMD business
[47:16.6 - 47:19.4] due to a decision not to renew an expiring program
[47:19.4 - 47:21.8] with an aim to improve overall profitability.
[47:22.7 - 47:26.1] Non-IFRS operating margin is expected to come in at 6.7%,
[47:26.1 - 47:28.8] which would be 20 basis points of margin expansion
[47:28.8 - 47:30.7] compared to our 2024 outlook,
[47:30.7 - 47:32.1] driven by operating leverage
[47:32.1 - 47:35.1] and improved profitability in both segments.
[47:35.1 - 47:37.8] Our outlook of adjusted EPS of $4.42
[47:37.8 - 47:40.6] is 15% higher compared to our 2024 outlook,
[47:40.6 - 47:44.3] ahead of our long-term target CAGR of 10% or more.
[47:45.7 - 47:47.7] Capital expenditures are expected to remain
[47:47.7 - 47:51.1] between 1.5% and 2.0% of revenue
[47:51.1 - 47:53.5] within our historical range.
[47:53.5 - 47:56.3] Finally, we are anticipating adjusted free cash flow
[47:56.3 - 47:58.4] of $325 million,
[47:58.4 - 48:02.5] which would represent growth of 18% over our 2024 outlook.
[48:03.7 - 48:05.1] Our current outlook for 2025
[48:05.1 - 48:07.1] represents our high confidence view
[48:07.1 - 48:09.7] based on current discussions with our customers.
[48:09.7 - 48:12.1] These conversations are active and ongoing,
[48:12.1 - 48:13.5] and so we look forward to providing you
[48:13.5 - 48:14.9] with an update in January.
[48:16.1 - 48:19.1] Beyond 2025, we are encouraged by these discussions,
[48:19.1 - 48:21.6] which are supported by significant new wins
[48:21.6 - 48:23.1] and third-party forecasts for growth
[48:23.1 - 48:24.7] in our underlying markets.
[48:24.7 - 48:27.5] As such, we currently expect the momentum we are seeing
[48:27.5 - 48:30.4] to continue into 2026 and the medium term.
[48:32.1 - 48:34.7] Moving on to our capital allocation priorities.
[48:34.7 - 48:36.6] Our overall framework for capital allocation
[48:36.6 - 48:38.1] remains consistent.
[48:38.1 - 48:40.5] Over the long-term, we aim to return 50%
[48:40.5 - 48:42.6] of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders
[48:42.6 - 48:45.1] and reinvest 50% back into the business.
[48:46.1 - 48:47.4] Since the beginning of 2014,
[48:47.4 - 48:50.5] we have reduced our share of the standing by 36%.
[48:50.5 - 48:53.6] In that time, we've returned close to $1 billion in capital
[48:53.6 - 48:55.5] to our shareholders through buybacks.
[48:56.4 - 48:58.7] We will continue to deploy capital towards buybacks
[48:58.7 - 49:00.9] on an opportunistic basis.
[49:00.9 - 49:03.5] In addition, we remain focused on opportunities
[49:03.5 - 49:06.2] to reinvest back into the business through R&D,
[49:06.2 - 49:08.1] strategic investments in our manufacturing footprints
[49:08.1 - 49:10.2] and capabilities, and M&A.
[49:11.6 - 49:13.0] With respect to M&A,
[49:13.0 - 49:16.2] we evaluate potential targets on a continuous basis.
[49:16.2 - 49:18.8] As always, we continue to apply a strict filter
[49:18.8 - 49:22.3] to our evaluation process for any acquisition.
[49:22.3 - 49:24.8] From a strategic perspective, we target acquisitions
[49:24.8 - 49:26.9] which will allow us to enhance our capabilities
[49:26.9 - 49:29.9] and accelerate our scale in selected markets.
[49:29.9 - 49:31.4] Our financial hurdles require
[49:31.4 - 49:35.1] that our targets be adjusted ETF secretive in the first year
[49:35.1 - 49:38.2] and have a return on investment above our cost of capital
[49:38.2 - 49:39.7] by the second year or sooner.
[49:41.1 - 49:43.8] Given our conservative level of leverage
[49:43.8 - 49:46.1] and strong adjusted free cash flow generation,
[49:46.1 - 49:48.7] we have the financial capacity and the appetite
[49:48.7 - 49:50.6] to execute on a creative acquisition
[49:50.6 - 49:52.5] should the opportunity present itself.
[49:53.8 - 49:56.2] Finally, I'd like to discuss our financial performance
[49:56.2 - 49:59.5] and our current valuation relative to our EMS peers.
[49:59.5 - 50:00.7] In recent periods,
[50:00.7 - 50:02.4] Fletska has consistently delivered
[50:02.4 - 50:04.1] very strong financial performance
[50:04.1 - 50:05.6] and has diverged meaningfully
[50:05.6 - 50:08.6] from that of our peers in the EMS industry.
[50:08.6 - 50:10.3] On a trailing four-quarter basis
[50:10.3 - 50:11.5] as of the end of the third quarter,
[50:11.5 - 50:13.9] we have delivered revenue growth of 18%
[50:13.9 - 50:15.9] compared to an average of a 12% decline
[50:15.9 - 50:17.5] for our EMS peer group.
[50:17.5 - 50:20.1] In addition, our non-IFRS operating margin
[50:20.1 - 50:22.0] has expanded by 90 basis points
[50:22.0 - 50:25.5] and our adjusted ETF is up 60% over the same period.
[50:26.3 - 50:28.0] We believe our operating performance
[50:28.0 - 50:30.7] over the last 12 months has exceeded our peer group
[50:30.7 - 50:34.2] and our outlook through 2025 continues to be very strong.
[50:34.2 - 50:36.6] However, our 12-month forward price earnings
[50:36.6 - 50:38.2] will still remain in line with
[50:38.2 - 50:40.2] or below the EMS peer group average.
[50:41.4 - 50:43.5] In our view, Fletska's consistent,
[50:43.5 - 50:44.9] strong financial performance
[50:44.9 - 50:47.0] is not accurately reflected in our valuation
[50:47.0 - 50:50.1] and presents an opportunity for greater shareholder returns.
[50:51.6 - 50:54.2] With that, I'd now like to turn the call back over to Rob
[50:54.2 - 50:55.4] for his closing remarks.
[50:57.1 - 50:58.8] As we conclude our investor meeting,
[50:58.8 - 51:00.5] I want to emphasize that our business
[51:01.3 - 51:03.3] has a great deal of momentum in our favor.
[51:03.3 - 51:04.6] Over the past several years,
[51:04.6 - 51:07.1] we have accumulated a track record
[51:07.1 - 51:09.9] of delivering strong financial performance
[51:09.9 - 51:12.8] and consistent operational execution.
[51:12.8 - 51:15.4] We've also proven our ability to evolve
[51:15.4 - 51:18.8] having organically built a leading ODM offering.
[51:18.8 - 51:21.9] We will continue to execute on a strategic roadmap
[51:21.9 - 51:23.6] which will position us to capitalize
[51:23.6 - 51:26.6] on the significant growth opportunities that lie ahead
[51:26.6 - 51:30.0] and ultimately deliver value for our shareholders.
[51:30.0 - 51:33.0] Thank you for your time and continued support.
[51:33.0 - 51:35.4] That concludes our presentation today
[51:35.4 - 51:38.3] and we are now ready to move into Q&A.
[51:38.3 - 51:41.3] As a reminder, joining Mandeep and I for Q&A
[51:41.3 - 51:45.2] will be Jason Phillips, Todd Cooper, and Steve Doherty.
[51:45.2 - 51:48.2] Operator, I will now turn the call over to you.
[51:50.8 - 51:51.7] Thank you.
[51:51.7 - 51:52.5] Ladies and gentlemen,
[51:52.5 - 51:55.2] we will now begin the question and answer session.
[51:55.2 - 51:56.4] Should you have a question,
[51:56.4 - 51:58.1] please press star followed by the one
[51:58.1 - 51:59.8] on your telephone keypad.
[52:00.5 - 52:02.9] You will hear a prompt that your hand has been raised
[52:02.9 - 52:05.1] and should you wish to cancel your request,
[52:05.1 - 52:07.2] please press star followed by the two.
[52:07.2 - 52:08.7] If you're using a speakerphone,
[52:08.7 - 52:11.6] please lift the handset before pressing any keys.
[52:11.6 - 52:12.9] I would like to advise everyone
[52:12.9 - 52:16.1] to have a limit of one question and one follow-up.
[52:16.1 - 52:18.9] Your first question comes from the line of Daniel Chan
[52:18.9 - 52:20.1] from TD Cowen.
[52:20.1 - 52:20.9] Please go ahead.
[52:22.3 - 52:23.1] Hi, good afternoon.
[52:23.1 - 52:25.0] Congrats on the strong core drink guidance.
[52:25.0 - 52:27.6] A couple of questions on the communication side.
[52:27.6 - 52:29.1] I know that you've been talking a lot about
[52:29.1 - 52:31.9] the design of this new data center networks last week
[52:31.9 - 52:33.9] and that included some Cisco equipment
[52:33.9 - 52:35.7] in the new networks.
[52:35.7 - 52:38.1] Can you just talk about the potential wallet share dynamics
[52:38.1 - 52:40.4] with Cisco coming in as an additional supplier?
[52:42.6 - 52:44.0] Steve, you wanna take that?
[52:45.2 - 52:46.7] Sure.
[52:46.7 - 52:47.6] Thanks, Dan.
[52:47.6 - 52:49.6] And I think when we think about hyperscalers
[52:49.6 - 52:50.9] and how they make the decision,
[52:50.9 - 52:53.1] it tends to be a balance between
[52:53.1 - 52:55.4] what's the best solution for a particular application
[52:55.4 - 52:59.1] and availability to meet those deployment objectives,
[52:59.1 - 53:01.3] which is why we continue to invest in R&D
[53:01.3 - 53:03.7] and work closely with key technology providers
[53:03.7 - 53:07.0] to ensure that our platforms are timely and relevant
[53:07.0 - 53:09.8] to our target customers and the target markets.
[53:11.1 - 53:12.9] I believe as a result of the pandemic
[53:12.9 - 53:14.5] and the period of constraints that followed,
[53:14.5 - 53:16.3] many of our customers realized the need
[53:16.3 - 53:19.5] to have a backup plan or a secondary source.
[53:19.5 - 53:22.0] We've seen some of our customers qualify off the shelf
[53:22.0 - 53:24.4] or OEM solutions as that backup plan
[53:24.4 - 53:28.8] rather than creating another custom platform or solution.
[53:28.8 - 53:31.3] But fundamentally, we see this category of companies
[53:31.3 - 53:34.9] still believe that optimized hardware
[53:34.9 - 53:37.4] can be a competitive differentiator for them.
[53:37.4 - 53:39.5] They still wanna pay for what they need
[53:39.5 - 53:41.1] and only what they need,
[53:41.1 - 53:43.5] and they wanna be able to implement new innovations
[53:43.5 - 53:45.2] at their own speed.
[53:45.2 - 53:47.6] Therefore, we haven't really seen a meaningful shift
[53:47.6 - 53:49.3] in any hyperscaler behaviors,
[53:49.3 - 53:51.7] which plays to our strategy and our strengths.
[53:54.7 - 53:55.9] Hey, Dan, this is Jason.
[53:55.9 - 53:57.9] I would just add to that as well
[53:57.9 - 53:59.9] in terms of how we compete.
[54:01.8 - 54:04.6] We believe as a North American-based ODM
[54:04.6 - 54:07.5] that has been delivering system and rack-level solutions
[54:07.5 - 54:10.9] across all the core technologies in the data center
[54:10.9 - 54:13.0] that we're in an advantaged position.
[54:13.0 - 54:17.8] And while we talk about our HPS portfolio and offering
[54:17.8 - 54:20.6] and equated to an ODM offering,
[54:20.9 - 54:24.4] I would highlight that not all ODMs value propositions
[54:24.4 - 54:26.9] and capabilities are equal.
[54:26.9 - 54:29.6] When we look at what we're doing in the HPS space
[54:29.6 - 54:32.0] in particular, you heard it from Steve
[54:32.0 - 54:33.4] and in our prepared remarks,
[54:33.4 - 54:35.9] there's a lot of focus on customization
[54:35.9 - 54:40.5] for what I would say, this customization for optimization,
[54:40.5 - 54:43.8] not just at a solution level, a design level,
[54:43.8 - 54:45.5] but also at a supply chain level.
[54:45.5 - 54:47.7] I mean, we're anticipating,
[54:47.7 - 54:50.2] geographic requirements are changing rapidly.
[54:50.8 - 54:51.6] We've been accounting for that
[54:51.6 - 54:54.5] as we've been developing our engineering centers
[54:54.5 - 54:57.3] of excellence, as well as our manufacturing sites
[54:57.3 - 54:58.8] and accounting for that,
[54:58.8 - 55:00.7] as well as customization of the model.
[55:00.7 - 55:02.6] You heard Steve talk about our customers
[55:02.6 - 55:05.5] are looking for a specific offering
[55:05.5 - 55:06.4] and that's what they want.
[55:06.4 - 55:08.3] They don't necessarily want more than that.
[55:08.3 - 55:10.7] That's another area of strength for us as well.
[55:13.5 - 55:14.3] That's very helpful.
[55:14.3 - 55:15.9] Thank you so much for all that color.
[55:15.9 - 55:18.3] The other opportunity I wanted to dive into a little bit
[55:18.3 - 55:19.7] was on the backend networks.
[55:20.3 - 55:21.4] That seems to be a large opportunity
[55:21.4 - 55:23.1] for Ethernet vendors like yourself.
[55:23.1 - 55:25.7] So good to see you guys are leading that charge in 400G
[55:25.7 - 55:28.2] as well as it sounds like an 800G.
[55:28.2 - 55:30.6] How are your discussions with customers going
[55:30.6 - 55:32.1] about the backend opportunity?
[55:32.1 - 55:33.5] Are you guys winning share there
[55:33.5 - 55:35.9] or are you seeing some share shifts
[55:35.9 - 55:37.4] between the different vendors?
[55:38.7 - 55:40.6] Steve, you wanna start with that one?
[55:47.4 - 55:48.2] Steve?
[55:50.7 - 55:51.6] Apologies.
[55:51.6 - 55:53.7] Yeah, we see future solutions
[55:53.7 - 55:55.7] really continuing the trend towards Ethernet
[55:55.7 - 55:58.8] for both scale up and scale out applications.
[55:58.8 - 56:02.8] Leading innovations in speed and density are causing this
[56:02.8 - 56:06.2] and we see further improvements coming in this technology
[56:06.2 - 56:08.3] with things such as Ultra Ethernet
[56:08.3 - 56:12.1] for the scale AI applications.
[56:12.1 - 56:14.2] Overall, we see a significant increase
[56:14.2 - 56:16.4] in Ethernet connectivity and bandwidth
[56:17.0 - 56:20.1] to support many of the AI ML systems
[56:20.1 - 56:22.4] including those that are based around both merchant
[56:22.4 - 56:26.7] and custom ASICs or proprietary ASICs.
[56:26.7 - 56:30.0] At the same time, we see just generally AI ML
[56:30.0 - 56:31.4] is generating a lot more data,
[56:31.4 - 56:34.9] requiring a lot more networking required to move that data.
[56:34.9 - 56:37.2] And further, hyperscalers are adjusting
[56:37.2 - 56:39.3] their network architectures from centralized
[56:39.3 - 56:41.2] to more distributed architectures
[56:42.4 - 56:44.6] to optimize for latency or security
[56:44.6 - 56:46.9] or probably more importantly lately,
[56:46.9 - 56:48.4] the availability of power.
[56:48.4 - 56:51.1] And so this is requiring more and more
[56:51.1 - 56:53.4] and differentiated connectivity solutions
[56:53.4 - 56:55.4] which we're well-positioned to support.
[56:56.8 - 56:59.8] And we anticipate seeing continuous strong demand
[56:59.8 - 57:01.5] for these products going forward.
[57:03.3 - 57:05.5] Yeah, and Dan, I would just add as well
[57:05.5 - 57:07.3] in the spirit of the growing
[57:07.3 - 57:10.1] Ethernet networking opportunity,
[57:10.1 - 57:13.2] we've talked about pivoting and taking our roadmaps
[57:13.2 - 57:17.3] and pivoting from data center into the campus and the edge.
[57:17.3 - 57:19.1] And we've been rounding out our roadmaps
[57:19.1 - 57:21.0] to be applicable there.
[57:21.0 - 57:24.4] And we're seeing a lot of, I'd say, traction and uptake
[57:24.4 - 57:28.1] as we build out our capability, not just our roadmaps
[57:28.1 - 57:31.0] but also our software capabilities,
[57:31.0 - 57:34.0] our open-source software and sonic areas like that
[57:34.0 - 57:36.3] that are also creating more opportunities
[57:36.3 - 57:38.3] on the networking side for us as well.
[57:39.3 - 57:41.3] Great, thanks. I'll jump back in the queue.
[57:43.0 - 57:44.6] Thank you. And your next question
[57:44.6 - 57:46.5] comes from the line of Robert Young
[57:46.5 - 57:48.7] from Canico Genuity. Please go ahead.
[57:50.1 - 57:51.9] Hi, good evening.
[57:51.9 - 57:54.8] Would love to dig into this Grok win.
[57:54.8 - 57:56.6] Why was Celestia chosen?
[57:56.6 - 58:01.6] Was it a manufacturing partner in the silicon influential?
[58:02.5 - 58:05.3] Is there any HPS revenue attached to this?
[58:05.3 - 58:08.3] And you called it a strategic relationship.
[58:11.1 - 58:13.9] Is it a single source or are there multiple vendors there?
[58:13.9 - 58:16.9] A couple just crammed into one.
[58:16.9 - 58:20.6] Steve, do you want to start with that one?
[58:20.6 - 58:21.2] Sure, sure.
[58:21.2 - 58:23.8] So, we see the GROK win, as mentioned earlier,
[58:23.8 - 58:28.9] as a significant win for us and another important proof point
[58:28.9 - 58:32.3] for us entering the AI and ML compute space.
[58:32.3 - 58:34.9] You know, certainly the industry-leading position
[58:34.9 - 58:38.4] that we've established on the networking side has helped us
[58:38.8 - 58:41.1] to be credible in this space, as a lot
[58:41.1 - 58:46.0] of the underlying competencies and technologies
[58:46.0 - 58:49.3] that we develop in support of those programs are portable
[58:49.3 - 58:54.0] or, you know, transferable to this type of product.
[58:54.0 - 58:57.4] The initial engagement includes manufacturing predominantly,
[58:57.4 - 59:01.0] where today they have a source that's been providing some
[59:01.0 - 59:05.4] of the early pre-production prototype-type systems.
[59:05.4 - 59:09.1] We will enter with that current generation of product,
[59:09.1 - 59:13.4] but the plan is to have an increased level
[59:13.4 - 59:16.6] of design participation or involvement going forward
[59:16.6 - 59:18.4] in future generations of the products,
[59:18.4 - 59:20.6] which start nearly immediately.
[59:20.6 - 59:23.8] So, very happy to have that win,
[59:23.8 - 59:28.0] and I think it'll really help us build competency
[59:28.0 - 59:31.1] and credibility for the future.
[59:31.1 - 59:33.5] Was it built with your own go-to-market
[59:33.5 - 59:35.9] or was it done with a partner?
[59:37.9 - 59:40.6] I'm sorry, I missed the first part of that.
[59:40.6 - 59:41.4] Oh, sorry.
[59:41.4 - 59:43.3] Was this done with your own go-to-market effort
[59:43.3 - 59:45.1] or were you brought to this relationship
[59:45.1 - 59:47.1] with maybe the silicon manufacturer
[59:47.1 - 59:48.5] or something like that?
[59:48.5 - 59:49.4] Oh, good question.
[59:49.4 - 59:50.6] Yeah, good question.
[59:50.6 - 59:53.8] So, it really was our own go-to-market, and, you know,
[59:53.8 - 59:56.0] we have a strategy, a comprehensive strategy for us
[59:56.0 - 59:59.7] to participate in the increased level of AI, ML,
[59:59.7 - 60:03.3] compute spend across various market segmentations
[60:03.3 - 60:07.5] and so this specially data center operator
[60:07.5 - 60:10.1] is one of the categories that we've selected
[60:10.1 - 60:12.4] and that we have aligned ourselves with
[60:12.4 - 60:15.3] in terms of our offerings.
[60:15.3 - 60:18.9] However, we have built very strong relationships
[60:18.9 - 60:22.3] with some of the key ecosystem technology providers
[60:22.3 - 60:25.7] and oftentimes we get endorsements or leads
[60:25.7 - 60:28.3] or, in some cases, co-marketing efforts
[60:28.3 - 60:30.2] that go on with these companies
[60:30.4 - 60:33.6] that ultimately result in award decisions
[60:33.6 - 60:34.7] from these customers.
[60:39.1 - 60:41.5] Okay, and then maybe second question, just be around,
[60:41.5 - 60:43.1] can you just give an update on the pace
[60:43.1 - 60:45.5] and the win rate of the 800 gig programs?
[60:45.5 - 60:47.8] Are you still converting all of the 400 gig?
[60:47.8 - 60:49.5] Is it happening faster than you expected
[60:49.5 - 60:52.8] and is there any ASP difference that you can call out?
[60:52.8 - 60:54.1] Then I'll pass the line.
[60:55.5 - 60:59.5] Yeah, so certainly thinking about 800 gig
[60:59.5 - 61:01.5] as the continuation of the next generation
[61:01.5 - 61:03.8] of the 400 gig wins that we've had,
[61:03.8 - 61:05.7] we're very happy with the outcome
[61:05.7 - 61:08.6] of several different sourcing initiatives
[61:08.6 - 61:11.0] with our customers that have resulted in us
[61:11.0 - 61:14.4] winning the 800 gig for next generation of product.
[61:14.4 - 61:17.0] We have over half a dozen products
[61:17.0 - 61:19.0] that we're currently working on today.
[61:19.0 - 61:22.4] Many of those will lead to future iterations
[61:22.4 - 61:24.0] of those same products
[61:24.0 - 61:27.1] for specific applications or architectures
[61:27.1 - 61:30.9] and so we think it's a very significant position
[61:30.9 - 61:35.6] to be here with 800 gig with other potential customers
[61:35.6 - 61:38.8] and opportunities still in front of us.
[61:38.8 - 61:40.2] But most of those projects,
[61:40.2 - 61:43.8] well, all of those projects are very much on track.
[61:43.8 - 61:45.9] We have some pressure from customers to accelerate,
[61:45.9 - 61:50.9] which is natural and I think that we're continuing
[61:51.3 - 61:53.8] to see strong demand on those products.
[61:53.8 - 61:55.0] From an ASP perspective,
[61:55.0 - 62:00.0] certainly the silicon that underlies these designs
[62:00.0 - 62:02.0] is going to be more expensive
[62:02.0 - 62:05.3] and our focus is really on value-based pricing
[62:05.3 - 62:07.4] and not having pricing specifically tied
[62:07.4 - 62:11.4] to the value of a particular part or component.
[62:11.4 - 62:12.7] But from a revenue perspective,
[62:12.7 - 62:15.2] it will certainly improve the top line
[62:15.2 - 62:16.8] on a comparable volume.
[62:18.1 - 62:20.5] Rob, it's Mandy Pierce, just to add on.
[62:22.0 - 62:23.3] ASPs are going up,
[62:23.3 - 62:25.2] especially as you go from 400G to 800G,
[62:25.2 - 62:27.0] there is that uplift.
[62:27.0 - 62:28.5] I think the way to understand it
[62:28.5 - 62:29.8] as it impacts our business
[62:29.8 - 62:32.2] is we look at it on a portfolio basis.
[62:33.1 - 62:37.3] As you know, we do also do 1G and 100G switches
[62:37.3 - 62:40.6] and 25G switches and so from a portfolio perspective,
[62:40.6 - 62:43.3] when we look at the year-over-year change in ASPs
[62:43.3 - 62:46.9] between below 100, 400, 800,
[62:46.9 - 62:49.0] we're seeing probably around a low
[62:49.0 - 62:52.3] to mid-single-digit increase on the average ASPs
[62:52.3 - 62:54.6] and so, of course, you'd apply that to the switching business
[62:54.6 - 62:58.1] but it really comes down to the mix in the portfolio.
[63:00.3 - 63:03.8] And Rob, I would just comment on the demand piece as well.
[63:03.8 - 63:06.8] You had touched on the 400 to 800G transition
[63:06.8 - 63:08.4] and demand being strong.
[63:10.1 - 63:11.5] In some of our remarks today,
[63:11.5 - 63:13.3] you've heard the networking requirements.
[63:13.3 - 63:16.3] We expect when you look at a data center rack today,
[63:16.3 - 63:19.1] 15% to 20% of it's going to comprise of networking.
[63:19.1 - 63:21.8] We expect in the next two to three years
[63:21.8 - 63:23.4] that that's going to triple
[63:23.4 - 63:26.5] and so the AI infrastructure investment cycle
[63:26.5 - 63:29.3] and the workload is going to drive up
[63:29.3 - 63:31.1] the networking requirements and with that,
[63:31.1 - 63:34.8] we're just seeing very strong demand for 400G remain
[63:34.8 - 63:38.4] in 2025 and beyond while we see some very strong demand
[63:38.4 - 63:43.2] for 800G picking up in 2025.
[63:43.2 - 63:45.6] In terms of 800G wins,
[63:45.6 - 63:48.6] another point to call out in particular,
[63:49.6 - 63:51.9] we've had, I'd say outside of the hyperscalers,
[63:51.9 - 63:55.2] we've had some enterprise customers that have come back
[63:55.2 - 63:57.7] and we've started having discussions on 800G again.
[63:57.7 - 64:00.6] We had some competitors that were very aggressive
[64:00.6 - 64:05.2] with price to get in early on
[64:05.2 - 64:07.0] and performance has been a challenge
[64:07.0 - 64:09.1] and we're now circling back to those customers
[64:09.1 - 64:10.5] and having fruitful conversations
[64:10.5 - 64:13.9] which I think represent another growth opportunity for us.
[64:14.0 - 64:15.7] Great to hear, I'll pass the line.
[64:17.3 - 64:19.0] Thank you and your next question comes
[64:19.0 - 64:21.1] from the line of Matt Sherin from Steffel,
[64:21.1 - 64:22.0] please go ahead.
[64:23.5 - 64:27.0] Yes, thank you and thanks for all the information so far.
[64:27.0 - 64:29.4] I have a question regarding the guidance
[64:29.4 - 64:33.2] for CCS for next year, low double digits.
[64:33.2 - 64:35.2] How should we think about growth
[64:35.2 - 64:38.8] in the communication segment versus enterprise,
[64:38.8 - 64:41.3] particularly with the headwinds that you talked about
[64:41.6 - 64:43.5] with servers, should we expect enterprise
[64:43.5 - 64:46.1] to be down for the year
[64:46.1 - 64:49.4] and which would imply communications up 20% plus?
[64:49.4 - 64:51.2] So how should we think about that?
[64:53.0 - 64:55.0] Hi Matt, it's Andy here.
[64:55.0 - 64:57.1] Yeah, I think you're getting close to it.
[64:58.4 - 65:01.0] We continue to have a really strong outlook
[65:01.0 - 65:05.0] on enterprise overall on server side in particular
[65:05.0 - 65:08.1] but as you know, we are in the process right now
[65:08.2 - 65:09.8] of seeing a technology transition
[65:09.8 - 65:11.2] with our largest customer.
[65:11.2 - 65:13.4] And so because of that timing delay,
[65:14.3 - 65:17.6] we will see some lower revenue in the first half of 2025
[65:17.6 - 65:20.8] before it starts ramping again in the back half of 2025.
[65:20.8 - 65:22.6] And then we really do see that growth continuing
[65:22.6 - 65:26.0] because we've already now been winning programs
[65:26.0 - 65:29.2] for new server programs
[65:29.2 - 65:32.8] which are actually set to begin ramping in early 2026.
[65:32.8 - 65:34.6] So the overall growth trajectory
[65:34.6 - 65:37.2] for enterprise is going to be a little bit different
[65:37.2 - 65:38.7] but the overall trajectory for enterprise
[65:38.7 - 65:40.8] continues to be very strong.
[65:40.8 - 65:42.5] But because of that timing of that transition
[65:42.5 - 65:44.9] which we've talked about for a couple of quarters now,
[65:44.9 - 65:47.4] we do expect enterprise to be down next year.
[65:47.4 - 65:50.0] And that's going to be more than offset though
[65:50.0 - 65:52.0] by very strong double digit growth
[65:52.0 - 65:55.6] to your point above 20% in the communication side
[65:55.6 - 66:00.6] led by increasing levels of deliveries
[66:00.6 - 66:03.9] on 800G switches primarily going into next year.
[66:05.1 - 66:06.3] Okay, great.
[66:06.3 - 66:09.1] And then just on the enterprise business,
[66:09.1 - 66:10.8] you're clearly in communications,
[66:10.8 - 66:12.3] you have a moat, right,
[66:12.3 - 66:17.1] with that ODM strategy and your own design.
[66:17.1 - 66:20.1] But you can argue that within the enterprise,
[66:20.1 - 66:21.7] the server business,
[66:21.7 - 66:23.6] you've got at least two very strong
[66:23.6 - 66:25.1] North American competitors
[66:25.1 - 66:29.4] and all acquiring different technologies
[66:29.4 - 66:32.0] like liquid cooling and power management.
[66:32.0 - 66:35.8] And then you've got the ODMs also spreading out
[66:35.8 - 66:39.7] in terms of their geographic diversification, et cetera.
[66:39.7 - 66:41.6] So I guess the question is,
[66:41.6 - 66:44.6] should we expect some incremental pricing pressure
[66:44.6 - 66:45.5] in that business?
[66:45.5 - 66:49.7] And what's your strategy around that
[66:49.7 - 66:52.5] in taking share versus being more disciplined?
[66:54.2 - 66:55.5] Hi, Matt, this is Jason.
[66:55.5 - 66:58.5] And maybe I'll start with what I would describe
[66:58.5 - 67:01.3] as our competitive differentiation
[67:01.3 - 67:03.8] and advantage in the compute,
[67:03.8 - 67:05.9] specifically AIML and what I describe
[67:05.9 - 67:07.8] as proprietary compute.
[67:07.8 - 67:08.9] First I'd start with,
[67:08.9 - 67:12.7] we've been involved in highly complex,
[67:12.7 - 67:16.2] custom AI ML systems and rack level solutions
[67:16.2 - 67:21.2] now for four product program generations at scale.
[67:21.8 - 67:22.9] So that's a long time
[67:22.9 - 67:26.5] and I'd emphasize the keyword at scale.
[67:26.5 - 67:30.5] It takes years to become competent in this area.
[67:30.5 - 67:33.2] And then I'd say it takes years on top of that
[67:33.2 - 67:35.8] to become proficient in that space.
[67:35.8 - 67:40.4] So while competitors will be looking to get in,
[67:40.4 - 67:45.2] to do it at scale, it's not easy, it takes time.
[67:45.2 - 67:47.4] And we've been making a tremendous amount of investments
[67:47.4 - 67:49.8] in that area, both on the engineering
[67:49.8 - 67:54.5] as well as the manufacturing side to do that.
[67:54.5 - 67:56.0] In terms of some of the announcements,
[67:56.0 - 67:58.4] I mean, there's been a flurry of announcements
[67:58.4 - 68:02.5] around reference designs, around partnerships.
[68:02.5 - 68:06.3] I would say that we were there at one point in time
[68:06.3 - 68:08.8] in our past, but we're well down the road
[68:08.8 - 68:10.8] and beyond that innovating at a,
[68:10.8 - 68:13.0] what I would describe as system level.
[68:13.0 - 68:15.3] So at the system and the rack level,
[68:15.3 - 68:18.1] we're working with our ecosystem partners
[68:18.1 - 68:20.7] to optimize performance at a system level,
[68:20.7 - 68:23.8] ultimately to enable our customers.
[68:23.8 - 68:26.3] So instead of taking what an ecosystem partner says,
[68:26.3 - 68:29.9] a certain spec of their solution or component can drive,
[68:29.9 - 68:33.4] we're asking them, we want you to solve
[68:33.4 - 68:35.4] for a system level that's performing at this.
[68:35.4 - 68:37.7] What can you do to get us there?
[68:37.7 - 68:41.7] So I think our innovation at a system and a rack level
[68:41.7 - 68:44.4] and the amount of investment we've been making
[68:44.4 - 68:47.0] and the time that we've been making it at
[68:47.0 - 68:50.6] is a competitive differentiator for us today
[68:50.6 - 68:51.6] and moving forward.
[68:51.6 - 68:55.5] And I would say that the word is getting out in the industry.
[68:55.5 - 68:57.6] We've been fairly quiet about it.
[68:57.6 - 69:00.9] We just stay focused on enabling our customers,
[69:00.9 - 69:04.6] but that growing, the capability at scale,
[69:04.6 - 69:05.7] I'd say is growing.
[69:05.7 - 69:07.5] And then on the cooling side,
[69:07.5 - 69:10.2] we've talked about it in some of our prepared remarks.
[69:10.2 - 69:11.9] I mean, we're well down the path there.
[69:11.9 - 69:14.6] We've been working on a pump two phase POC
[69:14.6 - 69:16.2] for quite some time.
[69:16.2 - 69:18.6] We've got a lot of interest from customers.
[69:18.6 - 69:21.7] We're excited about where that can go at a system level,
[69:21.7 - 69:24.1] but also at a rack level
[69:24.1 - 69:25.9] and leveraging our networking,
[69:26.0 - 69:28.6] industry-leading networking position there as well.
[69:30.2 - 69:31.1] Okay, great.
[69:31.1 - 69:32.6] And just on the pricing side,
[69:32.6 - 69:35.4] are you seeing more pricing pressure or expecting that?
[69:37.3 - 69:38.8] Steve, you wanna take that one?
[69:40.5 - 69:43.2] Yeah, so I think it's a natural part of the process
[69:43.2 - 69:46.3] that our customers are looking for us
[69:46.3 - 69:50.4] to drive competitive pricing as well as innovation,
[69:50.4 - 69:52.2] but really where we differentiate
[69:52.2 - 69:54.5] is on that innovation side.
[69:54.6 - 69:57.6] We add a lot of value to our customers
[69:57.6 - 69:59.2] by getting involved very early
[69:59.2 - 70:01.2] in the product realization process,
[70:02.2 - 70:04.2] all the way from design through NPI
[70:04.2 - 70:06.4] and launch into product manufacturing.
[70:06.4 - 70:10.3] And as you mentioned earlier,
[70:10.3 - 70:11.8] or characterized as headwinds,
[70:12.8 - 70:15.9] we really see this as normal technology transitions
[70:15.9 - 70:18.2] and some of it is the non-linear nature
[70:18.2 - 70:20.8] of data center deployments.
[70:20.8 - 70:23.0] And we're not really overly concerned
[70:23.1 - 70:26.1] as we've really recently secured
[70:26.1 - 70:29.2] the next generation of AI ML products
[70:29.2 - 70:30.6] from some of our existing customers
[70:30.6 - 70:34.1] as well as the introduction of some new customers
[70:34.1 - 70:35.0] such as Grok.
[70:35.0 - 70:38.9] And so further, where we see our customers
[70:38.9 - 70:40.4] have made decisions to dual source
[70:40.4 - 70:43.3] and this is where we get some of the direct
[70:43.3 - 70:45.6] competitive comparisons,
[70:45.6 - 70:47.9] we typically enter those engagements
[70:47.9 - 70:49.5] as the lead partner,
[70:49.5 - 70:52.0] engaging very early in the process as I mentioned.
[70:52.8 - 70:55.3] And typically maintain exclusivity
[70:55.3 - 70:57.9] or near exclusivity for a period of time
[70:57.9 - 71:00.4] until the product is really stabilized
[71:00.4 - 71:04.3] and ourselves and the customer agree
[71:04.3 - 71:06.4] that it's lower risk to bring on a second source.
[71:06.4 - 71:10.7] So we continue to see the AI ML compute systems
[71:10.7 - 71:13.6] as another strong area of growth for us going forward.
[71:14.9 - 71:16.3] Okay, thank you very much.
[71:16.3 - 71:17.9] I would just add to that
[71:17.9 - 71:20.4] in terms of the areas
[71:20.4 - 71:22.8] where we are dual sourced on programs,
[71:22.8 - 71:23.9] as Steve had mentioned,
[71:23.9 - 71:25.9] I would say our performance
[71:26.8 - 71:29.6] has allowed us to maintain the majority share there
[71:29.6 - 71:33.1] and we remain focused on staying
[71:33.1 - 71:35.0] at the top of our customer scorecards.
[71:36.1 - 71:37.0] Okay, got it.
[71:37.0 - 71:37.8] Thanks a lot.
[71:39.9 - 71:40.8] Thank you.
[71:40.8 - 71:41.9] And your next question comes
[71:41.9 - 71:44.0] from the line of Stanis Michopoulos
[71:44.0 - 71:45.7] from BMO Capital Markets.
[71:45.7 - 71:46.6] Please go ahead.
[71:47.8 - 71:48.8] Hi, good afternoon.
[71:49.7 - 71:51.5] Starting off with a question for Mandeep,
[71:51.5 - 71:56.3] which is you're guiding for a 6.7% margin in 2025,
[71:56.3 - 71:59.1] which is the same as you had in Q3
[71:59.1 - 72:00.6] and as you're guiding for Q4.
[72:01.9 - 72:04.0] Any particular puts and takes to think about
[72:04.0 - 72:06.0] in terms of why you wouldn't be seeing
[72:06.0 - 72:08.9] some margin improvements with operating leverage next year?
[72:11.7 - 72:13.7] Yeah, hey Stanis, good to hear from you.
[72:13.7 - 72:17.1] Look, we're happy with the 6.7% we had in the third quarter.
[72:17.2 - 72:19.7] It's the highest in the company's history.
[72:19.7 - 72:24.1] Really nice to see CCS perform at the levels that they did.
[72:25.1 - 72:28.3] Can we expect CCS to perform at that exact number
[72:28.3 - 72:30.7] every quarter from now till the end of 2025?
[72:30.7 - 72:33.3] Maybe, but at the same time,
[72:33.3 - 72:35.1] we're taking into account that
[72:35.1 - 72:37.4] there are mixed impacts along the way.
[72:37.4 - 72:42.0] We are expecting margin improvement in overall ATS
[72:43.0 - 72:46.1] as we get some better operating leverage.
[72:46.2 - 72:49.4] We talked about some of the portfolio actions
[72:49.4 - 72:52.3] that have been taken at a program level within A&D,
[72:52.3 - 72:56.5] and so we do expect some improving level of a margin,
[72:56.5 - 72:59.6] but it's going to be more back-end loaded overall.
[72:59.6 - 73:02.3] So we think right now the 6.7%
[73:02.3 - 73:04.9] is something that we're highly confident in
[73:04.9 - 73:09.5] and we're really happy to see the flow to the bottom line
[73:09.5 - 73:13.3] to drive 15% EPS growth right now.
[73:13.3 - 73:15.5] And again, we just want to kind of,
[73:15.5 - 73:17.3] I'd say, reiterate two things.
[73:17.3 - 73:21.1] One is it's our high-confidence view,
[73:21.1 - 73:23.1] what we're giving right now for 2025,
[73:23.1 - 73:25.9] and in addition, it's October as well,
[73:25.9 - 73:27.5] and so we do look forward
[73:27.5 - 73:30.3] as we get some firmer customer forecasts
[73:30.3 - 73:33.1] over the coming months to give an update in January.
[73:34.8 - 73:35.9] Great.
[73:35.9 - 73:38.2] And then a question probably for Jason,
[73:38.2 - 73:42.4] which is if I look at your mix within CCS
[73:42.5 - 73:45.8] of the non-hyperscaler business,
[73:45.8 - 73:47.6] I guess primarily OEM business,
[73:47.6 - 73:49.9] it seems like that's relatively flattering
[73:49.9 - 73:52.3] to be down a little bit in 24 versus 23.
[73:53.3 - 73:54.2] Anything to call out there?
[73:54.2 - 73:56.2] Is that just reflective of your focus
[73:56.2 - 73:58.8] primarily in the higher margin hyperscaler
[73:58.8 - 74:02.3] and HPS opportunities or anything to call out?
[74:02.3 - 74:04.9] Yeah, it's a great, great question, Thanos.
[74:04.9 - 74:07.4] I'm actually, I'm pleased with,
[74:07.4 - 74:09.0] one, the growth of the overall business,
[74:09.0 - 74:14.1] but also the diversification inside the overall portfolio.
[74:14.1 - 74:16.7] We've seen some really strong diversification
[74:16.7 - 74:19.5] inside the hyperscaler business,
[74:19.5 - 74:20.7] and then additionally,
[74:20.7 - 74:24.6] we've got our portfolio solutions and services businesses,
[74:24.6 - 74:26.9] which we spent a lot of time investing
[74:26.9 - 74:30.5] in creating capability and building out the front ends,
[74:30.5 - 74:33.8] and we're starting to see real fruit from those efforts now.
[74:34.7 - 74:36.3] So portfolio solutions, again,
[74:36.3 - 74:39.6] is leveraging our HPS platforms as they are,
[74:39.6 - 74:43.3] oftentimes enabled with open-source software like Sonic,
[74:44.2 - 74:48.2] and I'm expecting that business to triple
[74:48.2 - 74:50.0] over the next three years,
[74:50.0 - 74:53.7] and we've recently just secured a major win
[74:53.7 - 74:57.8] with a large retailer that you would know by name
[74:57.8 - 74:59.8] as an example of one of the proof points
[74:59.8 - 75:01.8] in the success that we're having in that business,
[75:01.8 - 75:05.3] and we're establishing a number of channel partnerships there,
[75:05.3 - 75:09.2] so I feel good about the growth prospects there
[75:09.2 - 75:11.9] and the extent of the value proposition
[75:11.9 - 75:14.3] that those customers leverage from us,
[75:14.3 - 75:16.8] and then when we look at our services business,
[75:16.8 - 75:19.1] you know, with the recent acquisition of NCS Global,
[75:19.1 - 75:20.8] we've really bolstered
[75:20.8 - 75:25.7] our overall IT asset disposition capability,
[75:25.7 - 75:28.5] which is going to help us help our customers
[75:28.5 - 75:30.9] manage their assets throughout their product lifecycle.
[75:30.9 - 75:33.5] When you look at the amount of infrastructure
[75:33.7 - 75:35.5] that is being deployed now,
[75:35.5 - 75:38.5] the upgrade cycles that are going to be happening,
[75:38.5 - 75:42.5] we're very well positioned to help service their services needs
[75:42.5 - 75:45.1] as well as their IT asset disposition requirements,
[75:45.1 - 75:46.5] and when I look over the next three years,
[75:46.5 - 75:49.2] I expect our ITAD business to triple as well,
[75:49.2 - 75:51.5] so overall, pleased with the progress
[75:51.5 - 75:54.5] and, you know, excited about what 2025 brings.
[75:57.5 - 75:59.3] All right, I'll pass the line. Thanks.
[76:01.2 - 76:03.2] Thank you, and your next question
[76:03.2 - 76:06.6] comes from the line of Stephen Fox from Fox Advisors.
[76:06.6 - 76:08.7] Please proceed.
[76:08.7 - 76:10.9] Thanks. Good afternoon.
[76:10.9 - 76:15.9] Had two questions. First off, on the ATS prospects,
[76:15.9 - 76:21.0] top-line prospects for getting back to 10% revenue growth,
[76:21.0 - 76:23.7] can you just sort of walk through the risks
[76:23.7 - 76:25.8] and opportunities there?
[76:25.8 - 76:28.6] This is the second year being below it,
[76:28.6 - 76:32.0] understanding the track record of growth.
[76:32.1 - 76:35.5] Like, where does you see the turn in that business
[76:35.5 - 76:37.7] to get back on that type of trajectory?
[76:37.7 - 76:39.3] And then I had a follow-up.
[76:41.5 - 76:43.5] Okay. Hey, Stephen.
[76:43.5 - 76:47.6] Todd Cooper here. Good evening. Thanks for the question.
[76:47.6 - 76:49.3] I'd say from an ATS point of view,
[76:49.3 - 76:54.7] we are focused on getting back to the 10% year-over-year growth.
[76:54.7 - 76:57.1] We have been impacted, I think,
[76:57.1 - 76:58.7] and I've read a number of your reports,
[76:58.7 - 77:00.2] and I think you cover it quite well,
[77:00.2 - 77:03.0] but in our industrial segment,
[77:03.0 - 77:06.7] which is the largest of the four ATS segments,
[77:06.7 - 77:10.0] we've really been impacted over the last year
[77:10.0 - 77:12.9] by what I'll call a bubble of customer inventory
[77:12.9 - 77:15.7] that was really created coming out of COVID
[77:15.7 - 77:18.7] and the extreme material constraints
[77:18.7 - 77:22.6] that happened in 21, 22, first half of 23,
[77:22.6 - 77:23.9] left a lot of our customers
[77:23.9 - 77:26.2] with just a significant amount of inventory
[77:26.2 - 77:29.2] they had to burn through.
[77:30.2 - 77:31.8] We've been partnering with our customers.
[77:31.8 - 77:33.3] They've been working through that inventory
[77:33.3 - 77:34.9] over the last 12 months.
[77:34.8 - 77:42.5] We see the industrial market broadly beginning to stabilize and with a path to return to
[77:42.5 - 77:45.0] growth next year.
[77:45.0 - 77:51.4] I say all of that, again, in context of our largest segment, with the one caveat that
[77:51.4 - 77:58.7] EV chargers – maybe two caveats – EV chargers and factory automation, which comprise part
[77:58.7 - 78:06.1] of our industrial segment, we think they're still sitting on elevated levels of inventory,
[78:06.1 - 78:11.3] really driven by the high expectations for those businesses versus the reality of their
[78:11.3 - 78:12.3] demand.
[78:12.3 - 78:16.5] We see positive demand, not negative, but we think in those two areas of industrial
[78:16.5 - 78:20.8] it will likely be the second half of next year before they return to more normal demand.
[78:20.8 - 78:26.0] So I'd say that's probably been the largest detractor.
[78:26.0 - 78:31.6] Industrial equipment has been strong this year, candidly stronger than we expected.
[78:31.6 - 78:40.1] We're seeing another strong year ahead in 2025 and even 2026 beyond that.
[78:40.1 - 78:44.9] If you look at the UBS report that came out in September, with most analysts still and
[78:44.9 - 78:52.7] many of our customers still projecting a trillion-dollar semiconductor market by 2030, which would
[78:52.7 - 79:05.5] imply $150-170 billion of semiconductor equipment versus the $96 billion level we're at today.
[79:05.5 - 79:09.5] And then in health tech, our smallest – and I'll pause after that – in health tech,
[79:09.5 - 79:16.6] which is our smallest segment, we've actually won a number of large finished product programs
[79:16.6 - 79:21.1] in diabetes and imaging and diagnostics.
[79:21.1 - 79:26.4] Because they're finished products, they take two to three years to ramp.
[79:26.4 - 79:31.2] We're in the early stages of those ramps, and I fully expect that our health tech business
[79:31.2 - 79:35.6] will double based on, again, this already won in ramping business over the next three
[79:35.6 - 79:36.6] to four years.
[79:36.6 - 79:37.6] Great.
[79:37.6 - 79:38.6] Thanks, Todd.
[79:38.6 - 79:39.6] That's really helpful.
[79:39.6 - 79:45.2] And then just as a follow-up, if I think about just stepping back big picture in the CCS
[79:45.2 - 79:49.7] business, it seems like the holy grail is to be doing as much as you can on the rack
[79:49.8 - 79:51.8] that you showed on slide 11.
[79:51.8 - 79:56.0] And you sort of alluded to different ways that you're going about sort of leveraging
[79:56.0 - 79:59.9] different component wins into more system wins, et cetera.
[79:59.9 - 80:05.7] Can you sort of give us perspective on that vision and the vision for services?
[80:05.7 - 80:11.3] How much does that sort of contribute to growth now versus what it could be, and what kind
[80:11.3 - 80:17.4] of work do you have to do to really, where possible, gain more share of wallet at big
[80:17.4 - 80:18.4] customers?
[80:19.4 - 80:20.4] Hey, Stephen.
[80:20.4 - 80:21.4] This is Jason.
[80:21.4 - 80:22.4] Yeah.
[80:22.4 - 80:28.6] So, I mean, ultimately, that is the goal, is to enable our customers with as many of
[80:28.6 - 80:31.6] the systems in the rack as possible.
[80:31.6 - 80:37.5] We made a very conscious decision, you know, back in 2009 when we started in HPS and ODM
[80:37.5 - 80:44.5] to focus at a system level, and we had a very strong storage position then.
[80:44.5 - 80:48.8] We continue to today, you know, doing business for the top six, and now taking what I'd call
[80:48.8 - 80:53.9] our enterprise-class storage solutions into the hyperscaler market, which has got some
[80:53.9 - 80:56.3] exciting potential.
[80:56.3 - 81:00.4] And then we developed, you know, networking, and this industry-leading networking position
[81:00.4 - 81:03.0] now focused very much on the high end of the data center.
[81:03.0 - 81:06.1] You know, 400G was our big breakthrough.
[81:06.1 - 81:11.2] We've now moved into 800G, secured all the wins in 800, where we had 400G engagements,
[81:11.8 - 81:18.3] and we just announced a big 1.6 terabit win with what I would say an exponential amount
[81:18.3 - 81:23.9] of interest from 800 to 1.6 that continues to grow.
[81:23.9 - 81:29.1] And so we've got an industry-leading position there on the merchant side of Silicon.
[81:29.1 - 81:34.3] And then AIML Compute, where we've just announced, you know, in addition to having what I'd call
[81:34.3 - 81:43.6] an industry-leading custom ASIC AIML position, we are developing a modular HPS AIML platform
[81:43.6 - 81:50.7] that will be able to support both merchant and custom Silicon types, and we're very excited
[81:50.7 - 81:52.7] about the prospects there.
[81:52.7 - 81:59.2] We just recently announced a partnership with AMD where we're going to prove that out on MI325.
[81:59.2 - 82:03.4] So you can see our progression from 2009 to where we are.
[82:03.4 - 82:08.8] We've gone from, you know, we remain focused at innovating at a system level and enabling
[82:08.8 - 82:14.8] our customers with optimized solutions for their applications and for their software,
[82:14.8 - 82:19.3] and that naturally progresses and translates into rack-level solutions, where we're doing,
[82:19.3 - 82:24.5] I'd say, more rack-level orchestration, and it's different than just system integration.
[82:24.5 - 82:27.8] It's rack-level orchestration for our customers.
[82:27.8 - 82:31.4] So again, we're going to remain focused on enabling them.
[82:31.4 - 82:35.3] You know, we've been making significant investments since 2009.
[82:35.3 - 82:41.8] We're approaching half a billion dollars of R&D investment as we approach the end of 2024,
[82:41.8 - 82:47.8] and all that is culminating into a robust portfolio of system and rack-level solutions.
[82:47.8 - 82:49.0] Great. That's great perspective.
[82:49.0 - 82:52.0] Thank you very much.
[82:52.0 - 82:52.6] Thank you.
[82:52.6 - 82:57.0] And your next question comes from the line of Jesse Pitlach from Cormark.
[82:57.0 - 82:59.4] Please go ahead.
[82:59.4 - 82:59.9] Hey, good evening.
[82:59.9 - 83:05.7] Just coming back to the digital natives, are a lot of the discussions that you're having
[83:05.7 - 83:08.9] with this group, are they kind of like the Grok one, where it sounds like it's starting
[83:08.9 - 83:13.2] off as manufacturing and then the idea is eventually to move into design, or are you
[83:13.2 - 83:17.6] having design discussions with some of these parties already?
[83:17.6 - 83:19.4] Steve, why don't you take that one?
[83:19.4 - 83:20.2] Sure.
[83:20.2 - 83:22.1] Yeah, I think it's really both.
[83:22.8 - 83:28.8] In many cases, when we look at these kinds of opportunities, one of the key decision
[83:28.8 - 83:34.3] criteria when we're assessing the strategic fit of these companies as a potential customer
[83:35.4 - 83:43.4] is really about the opportunity to have more design involvement and to have a broader
[83:43.4 - 83:46.8] offering or have them need the broader offering that we can provide.
[83:47.7 - 83:52.5] So, it's not unusual to start the relationship on current generation product.
[83:53.2 - 83:55.3] It helps kind of as a pipe cleaner.
[83:55.3 - 84:01.2] It allows us to get familiar with each other and familiar with the products and some real-time
[84:01.2 - 84:04.0] experience that's applicable into the next generation.
[84:04.0 - 84:06.5] So, it's not uncommon to start off that way.
[84:06.5 - 84:13.6] However, we have others where they look at the portfolio of platform solutions that we
[84:13.6 - 84:13.9] have.
[84:14.5 - 84:21.2] They look at ways that they can potentially iterate and customize and, in some cases,
[84:21.9 - 84:26.4] use as is in their infrastructure or in their racks.
[84:26.4 - 84:34.7] And so, that often leads to a fair amount of HPS participation right from the beginning.
[84:37.5 - 84:38.0] That's helpful.
[84:38.0 - 84:42.4] And if you could, can you maybe just characterize their aggressiveness in terms of spending?
[84:42.4 - 84:47.1] Are they ready to really open the wallet or are they still trying to solidify their planning?
[84:47.1 - 84:52.8] Yeah, it varies.
[84:52.8 - 84:57.0] I hate to give the depends answer, but it kind of depends on where they are in their
[84:58.1 - 84:58.7] development.
[84:59.6 - 85:02.2] In some cases, these are emerging companies.
[85:03.2 - 85:12.0] They have some niche kinds of technologies and have a market that's very interested in
[85:12.0 - 85:14.9] those kinds of solutions and offerings.
[85:15.0 - 85:20.1] And so, it does vary a bit from customer to customer.
[85:20.1 - 85:22.5] But it's, again, part of our criteria.
[85:22.5 - 85:26.2] We look at the kinds of companies that we think we can really bring differentiated value
[85:26.2 - 85:27.7] to and that we want to align with.
[85:28.9 - 85:33.5] And, Jesse, I would just add to that, with these companies, there's a willingness to
[85:33.5 - 85:40.3] leverage a broader portion of the value proposition that we can deliver right away.
[85:40.3 - 85:44.3] Sometimes it takes time to build up that relationship with customers where they take more
[85:44.3 - 85:47.7] advantage of the value proposition that we can help enable them with.
[85:47.7 - 85:51.6] I'd say with this customer class, there's a greater willingness right out of the gate
[85:51.6 - 85:58.1] to get scaling as quickly as possible and leverage many of the services that we offer.
[85:59.4 - 86:00.8] That makes a lot of sense.
[86:00.8 - 86:01.2] Thanks for that.
[86:01.2 - 86:01.9] I'll pass the line.
[86:04.4 - 86:04.8] Thank you.
[86:04.8 - 86:09.0] And your next question comes from the line of Paul Traber from RBC Capital Markets.
[86:09.0 - 86:09.7] Please go ahead.
[86:09.7 - 86:12.5] Oh, thanks very much.
[86:12.5 - 86:14.1] And good afternoon.
[86:14.9 - 86:20.4] Just a high-level question on customer mix and diversification within CCS.
[86:21.2 - 86:24.0] You did speak about the opportunity with digital natives.
[86:24.7 - 86:29.7] But the large Tier 1 hyperscalers are still and probably will be a large portion of the
[86:29.7 - 86:30.6] market.
[86:30.6 - 86:37.4] Now, how do you see your opportunity with other large Tier 1 hyperscalers?
[86:38.3 - 86:42.5] And what's the strategy to drive in and capture more share with those?
[86:44.5 - 86:48.4] Hey, Paul, maybe I'll start and Steve can add some color here.
[86:49.2 - 86:53.2] So we continue to do business with the top five hyperscalers.
[86:53.2 - 86:58.1] And I would say I'm very pleased with the amount of diversification, as I mentioned
[86:58.1 - 87:00.3] a bit earlier, that's taken place there.
[87:00.3 - 87:05.6] Outside of our largest customer, we've seen tremendous growth with our other hyperscaler
[87:05.6 - 87:06.1] customers.
[87:07.2 - 87:12.9] And we've got, I'd say, very promising discussions ongoing in terms of building upon
[87:12.9 - 87:13.5] that growth.
[87:14.7 - 87:17.5] So strong diversification.
[87:17.5 - 87:22.2] Unfortunately, we can't provide too much color there in terms of the details, but pleased
[87:22.2 - 87:23.5] with the progress we're making there.
[87:27.1 - 87:31.7] I would just add to that that I mentioned earlier a comprehensive strategy to participate
[87:31.7 - 87:37.4] across many of these growing markets, specifically those being driven by AI and ML
[87:37.4 - 87:38.3] applications.
[87:38.3 - 87:45.2] So from the hyperscalers with cloud services, the specialized clouds, the large enterprise,
[87:46.0 - 87:51.4] and even working with OEMs and working through channels to address some of the SMB
[87:51.4 - 87:52.0] opportunities.
[87:52.0 - 87:55.2] So we have a strategy to go broad across this.
[87:55.2 - 88:01.1] When we think about the hyperscalers, they tend to be the drivers or the pioneers of
[88:01.1 - 88:02.4] new technologies.
[88:02.4 - 88:06.9] And oftentimes those technologies have a long life after the hyperscalers have moved on
[88:06.9 - 88:07.8] to the next thing.
[88:07.8 - 88:13.6] So it's always part of the strategy to look at opportunities to leverage the investments
[88:13.6 - 88:18.7] that we've made, the scale that we've achieved, and the relationships that we have with the
[88:18.7 - 88:23.2] ecosystem partners to have compelling solutions across that broad market.
[88:24.2 - 88:24.8] Thanks for that.
[88:24.8 - 88:32.8] And then a follow-up question, I mean, you've discussed pricing and looking at this market.
[88:35.3 - 88:42.6] How are hyperscalers at this point, are they taking price into consideration as one of
[88:42.6 - 88:44.8] the top priorities yet?
[88:44.8 - 88:49.0] Do you expect that that would happen at some point in the future where they may become
[88:49.2 - 88:55.7] more price sensitive than maybe what they have been in the last 12, 18, 24 months or
[88:55.7 - 88:56.2] so?
[89:00.8 - 89:04.2] Yeah, thanks for that question.
[89:04.2 - 89:11.0] I think that, as I mentioned before, when we think about pricing and hyperscalers and
[89:11.0 - 89:18.9] their approach to pricing, there's always a component of pricing available to them.
[89:19.6 - 89:25.1] And performance and ease of doing business are the criteria I think they usually assess
[89:25.1 - 89:26.6] their suppliers based on.
[89:26.6 - 89:32.7] And oftentimes, with leading-edge new technologies, that performance and availability is a key
[89:32.7 - 89:35.6] driver, followed closely by pricing.
[89:35.6 - 89:40.5] And so, as we think about just the pricing piece of that, as I mentioned before, it's
[89:40.5 - 89:47.2] really about moving to a more value-based pricing and finding more areas or opportunities
[89:47.2 - 89:50.0] for us to add value into the overall system.
[89:50.0 - 89:56.0] So, there's a number of make-versus-buy decisions that occur within something as complex as
[89:56.0 - 89:56.5] the RAC.
[89:57.7 - 89:58.8] There's Commie modules.
[89:58.8 - 89:59.3] There's NICs.
[89:59.3 - 90:06.9] There's other subsystems, CPU modules and power and fan complexes, those kinds of things.
[90:06.9 - 90:11.8] And so, we look at the ways that we can add value across the entire RAC or the entire
[90:11.8 - 90:16.0] system, which contributes to stronger pricing.
[90:17.2 - 90:20.4] We also like to look at ways to gain control of key commodities.
[90:20.4 - 90:27.9] So, sometimes our hyperscale customers like to have source control and stay closely aligned
[90:27.9 - 90:30.0] to some of the key commodities.
[90:30.0 - 90:33.6] But we're always finding ways to become more competitive there.
[90:33.6 - 90:38.7] And with some commodities, when you think about it, the only companies that buy more
[90:38.7 - 90:43.2] volume than hyperscalers are companies that are aggregating the demand of several end
[90:43.2 - 90:44.8] users like ourselves.
[90:44.8 - 90:49.1] And so, we're always looking for ways and working diligently to find these kinds of
[90:49.1 - 90:54.6] opportunities, you know, to ensure that our pricing remains competitive and our solutions
[90:54.6 - 90:55.2] are compelling.
[90:58.2 - 90:59.2] Thanks for taking the questions.
[91:01.7 - 91:02.3] Thank you.
[91:02.3 - 91:06.4] And your next question comes from the line of Ted Kaplan from CIBC.
[91:06.4 - 91:07.1] Please go ahead.
[91:08.9 - 91:09.7] Good evening, everyone.
[91:09.7 - 91:11.0] Thanks for taking my question.
[91:12.0 - 91:14.4] I was wondering if you could bridge the gap.
[91:15.0 - 91:20.5] You talk about roughly 30% growth in CCSN markets.
[91:20.5 - 91:27.6] Yet, when we look at hyperscaler CapEx for 2025, it's more or less low double-digit growth.
[91:28.3 - 91:33.4] And I'm just wondering, why is it that low?
[91:34.3 - 91:41.4] And are you basically implying, in your views, that that growth rate is actually going to
[91:41.4 - 91:43.8] accelerate in 2025?
[91:43.8 - 91:45.9] Some commentary on the market would be appreciated.
[91:45.9 - 91:46.4] Thanks a lot.
[91:48.0 - 91:49.0] Hey, Todd.
[91:49.0 - 91:49.6] Mandeep here.
[91:49.6 - 91:50.5] It's nice to talk to you.
[91:51.6 - 91:57.6] Sorry if it wasn't clear, but let me just clarify our revenue outlook overall.
[91:57.6 - 92:02.4] So, the $10.4 billion is 8% overall for the company.
[92:02.4 - 92:03.7] Again, it's our high-confidence view.
[92:04.6 - 92:09.1] We're seeing right now low double-digit growth in CCS.
[92:09.1 - 92:12.8] And we're seeing low single-digit growth in ATS.
[92:13.6 - 92:17.6] I know you didn't ask it, but just to round it out, on the ATS side, good level of growth
[92:17.6 - 92:18.4] across the portfolio.
[92:18.4 - 92:19.8] We're expecting everyone to grow.
[92:20.7 - 92:26.0] We are seeing the impact of that program decision that we've made in A&D offsetting some of
[92:26.0 - 92:26.8] the growth.
[92:26.8 - 92:30.4] And then some of the growth that we're expecting in industrial is more back-end loaded.
[92:31.3 - 92:37.7] On the CCS side, as I talked about a little bit earlier on, the enterprise, because of
[92:37.7 - 92:41.8] the program transitions, we do expect to see some level of decline next year.
[92:41.8 - 92:43.9] That's going to be more than offset on the communication side.
[92:43.9 - 92:48.6] Communications will be probably above 20%, 20% to 25%.
[92:50.5 - 92:52.4] And so, overall, we're really pleased with the growth.
[92:52.4 - 92:56.5] To your point on the hyperscaler CapEx, it is one thing that we are watching.
[92:57.6 - 92:59.0] Consensus numbers are only one thing.
[92:59.0 - 93:00.8] And then, of course, taking market share is another.
[93:00.8 - 93:06.0] But right now, hyperscaler CapEx in 2024 is going to be very, very strong, as everyone
[93:06.0 - 93:06.8] knows.
[93:06.8 - 93:10.1] I think consensus is somewhere in the 30% range.
[93:10.1 - 93:13.7] Consensus right now for hyperscaler CapEx next year is in the low double digits.
[93:14.5 - 93:20.6] And so that's reflected in our outlook right now.
[93:20.6 - 93:25.6] The one thing I will say when we talk about the high confidence, though, is we have very
[93:25.6 - 93:31.4] good open forecast conversations with our hyperscaler customers, which go out about
[93:31.4 - 93:32.3] 12 months.
[93:32.3 - 93:36.3] And so we have some pretty robust forecasts right now for Q1, 2, and 3.
[93:36.9 - 93:41.2] What we don't have is very robust forecasts yet for fourth quarter.
[93:41.2 - 93:44.8] And so that's one of the areas that we're really working on over the coming months to
[93:44.8 - 93:45.4] shore that up.
[93:46.4 - 93:49.4] So that's why, when we come back in January, we're hoping we can give an update in that
[93:49.4 - 93:49.7] regard.
[93:50.6 - 93:56.6] I guess my follow-up on that is, and again, this is more of a market question, when you
[93:56.6 - 94:05.0] hear companies like Snowflake say there isn't one Fortune 500 company in production with
[94:05.0 - 94:08.7] Gen AI applications, what do you think about that?
[94:08.7 - 94:15.8] Like, it seems like the market adoption still has a ways to go, and there's going to be
[94:15.8 - 94:16.9] digestion period.
[94:17.9 - 94:24.6] So I guess, from our perspective, it seems like some of that is baked into the hyperscaler
[94:24.6 - 94:25.6] CapEx for next year.
[94:25.6 - 94:29.1] I'm just wondering, at a corporate level, what you think about that as well.
[94:29.1 - 94:29.4] Thanks.
[94:32.6 - 94:33.1] Hey, Todd.
[94:33.1 - 94:34.3] Yeah, this is Jason.
[94:34.3 - 94:39.5] I guess one comment I would make on the CapEx numbers is it's important to recognize that
[94:39.5 - 94:45.2] inside of those numbers include everything that makes the data center work, including
[94:45.2 - 94:48.9] power, property, plant, equipment, all of that, right?
[94:48.9 - 94:54.9] So there's a lot that goes into that bucket, and so when we look at our growth rates and
[94:54.9 - 95:01.3] where the hyperscalers are deploying their CapEx, I think we feel very good about our
[95:01.3 - 95:02.4] level of growth.
[95:02.4 - 95:05.1] Steve, I don't know if there's anything you'd want to add to that.
[95:07.7 - 95:11.4] No, I think we're all set, unless there's follow-on questions.
[95:14.4 - 95:15.0] No, that's great.
[95:15.8 - 95:16.3] Thanks a lot.
[95:16.8 - 95:18.2] Todd, I'll just add on.
[95:20.6 - 95:22.4] To reiterate, we talked about 2025 already.
[95:22.4 - 95:23.6] It's our high-confidence view.
[95:24.3 - 95:28.5] We're really encouraged right now that we are already winning programs which are set
[95:28.5 - 95:30.5] to ramp starting in 2026.
[95:30.5 - 95:37.8] We've won new AI server programs with our largest customer, which are not in our 2025
[95:37.8 - 95:39.9] forecast, which are going to ramp in early 2026.
[95:40.8 - 95:46.6] We continue to see – well, we will be seeing the impact of the 1.6T program.
[95:47.4 - 95:53.5] We believe that's the first in the industry, which is going to be ramping in 2026, and
[95:53.5 - 95:58.8] we're having very active discussions with a number of hyperscalers on programs that
[95:58.8 - 96:03.7] could begin in 2025, that begin in 2026, and even programs that begin in 2027.
[96:04.3 - 96:08.6] And so, of course, we have to take this one year at a time, but the conversations with
[96:08.8 - 96:11.8] our customers at the program level are very encouraging.
[96:12.8 - 96:13.9] Thanks for the call, Armendi.
[96:14.8 - 96:15.7] Thank you.
[96:15.7 - 96:17.6] There are no further questions at this time.
[96:18.1 - 96:21.7] I will now hand the call back to Mr. Rob Mionis for any closing remarks.
[96:22.9 - 96:26.2] Thank you, Operator, and thank you all for joining us this evening.
[96:26.8 - 96:30.9] Overall, I'm pleased with the execution of our strategy and that it continues to yield
[96:30.9 - 96:31.4] results.
[96:32.1 - 96:37.2] I'm also quite encouraged that our momentum is continuing into 2025 and beyond.
[96:38.0 - 96:43.0] Frankly, the products that we have in development right now give us the confidence in our outlook,
[96:43.0 - 96:45.4] and our future is certainly quite bright.
[96:46.0 - 96:48.9] We look forward to updating you in January, and have a good evening.
[96:50.0 - 96:52.0] Thank you, and this concludes today's call.
[96:52.0 - 96:53.3] Thank you for participating.
[96:53.3 - 96:54.5] You may all disconnect.
