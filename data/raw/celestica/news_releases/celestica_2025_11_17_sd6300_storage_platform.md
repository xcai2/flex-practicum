### Key Quotes

**Gavin Cato, SVP & GM Portfolio Solutions & AI Platform Engineering, Celestica:**
> "Data growth is an exponential challenge, and the SD6300 is our direct answer to helping enterprises and hyperscalers meet it head-on. Our engineering focus was simple: deliver the maximum storage density in a 4U enclosure for a standard 19" wide 1200 mm deep rack. As a result, this can be a powerful tool to help drive savings in both CapEx and OpEx while laying a high-performance foundation for data-intensive applications like AI archiving and analytics. This platform delivers the density, performance, and reliability the market demands."

**Don Jeanette, Vice President, TRENDFOCUS:**
> "The SD6300 is Celestica's next-generation ultra-high-density 4U JBOD with SAS-4 system uplink. It is the industry's most compact and densest storage expansion system, supporting 108 drive bays within a 1125 mm deep footprint. The SD6300 also features four dedicated SAS-4 drive bays, supporting SAS-4 solid-state drives (SSDs), to deliver greater overall system read and write performance. Celestica's SD6300 will be a much-welcomed storage system as organizations seek to maximize the utilization of their data center floor space and minimize CAPEX & OPEX spend. We find the SD6300 will be an ideal solution for AI ingest and archiving phases, traditional HA enterprise applications, as well as hyperscale environments. This latest offering illustrates the trust in the SAS infrastructure for performance and long-term reliability for many years."
