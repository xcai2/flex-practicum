[00:00.0 - 00:10.5] Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Celestica Q4 2023 Earnings Conference Call.
[00:10.5 - 00:13.8] At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode.
[00:13.8 - 00:18.1] Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.
[00:18.1 - 00:22.3] If at any time during this call you require immediate assistance, please press star 0
[00:22.3 - 00:23.3] for the operator.
[00:23.3 - 00:28.5] This call is being recorded on Tuesday, January 30, 2024.
[00:28.5 - 00:33.4] I would now like to turn the conference over to Craig Oberg, Vice President of Investor
[00:33.4 - 00:35.9] Relations and Corporate Development.
[00:35.9 - 00:36.9] Please go ahead.
[00:36.9 - 00:42.3] Good morning, and thank you for joining us on Celestica's Q4 2023 Earnings Conference
[00:42.3 - 00:43.3] Call.
[00:43.3 - 00:48.4] On the call today are Rob Maiones, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Mandeep Chawla,
[00:48.4 - 00:49.4] Chief Financial Officer.

[03:19.6 - 03:22.2] Let me now turn the call over to Rob.
[03:22.2 - 03:23.2] Thank you, Craig.
[03:23.2 - 03:26.9] Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call.
[03:26.9 - 03:33.4] We ended this year with a very strong fourth quarter, achieving revenue of $2.14 billion,
[03:33.4 - 03:39.3] which was towards the high end of our guidance range, while a non-IFRS adjusted EPS came
[03:39.3 - 03:43.6] in at 76 cents, exceeding the high end of our guidance range.
[03:43.6 - 03:50.5] Our non-IFRS operating margin was 6%, exceeding the midpoint of our revenue and non-IFRS adjusted
[03:50.5 - 03:53.4] EPS guidance ranges.
[03:53.4 - 03:57.9] The outperformance in the fourth quarter, relative to our guidance, was driven by continued
[03:57.9 - 04:04.2] strength in our CCS segment, supported by the sustained growth of our hyperscaler portfolio.
[04:04.2 - 04:08.9] We continue to see the benefit of improved mix on our CCS segment margin, which reached
[04:09.1 - 04:14.6] yet another new high of 6.7% in the fourth quarter.
[04:14.6 - 04:20.1] In our EPS segment, revenues were down slightly year to year as incremental demand softness
[04:20.1 - 04:25.9] in our industrial business and continued demand headwinds in our capital equipment business
[04:25.9 - 04:32.0] more than offset strong growth in our A&D business.
[04:32.0 - 04:36.9] Our solo performance in the fourth quarter capped a stellar year in 2023.
[04:36.9 - 04:41.8] Throughout this past year, we continued to execute on our strategic plan, enhanced our
[04:41.8 - 04:48.0] competitive presence in key markets, and consistently delivered on our financial objectives.
[04:48.0 - 04:54.8] In 2023, our business generated revenue of approximately $8 billion, 10% higher than
[04:54.8 - 05:02.2] 2022, driven by strong growth in both our CCS and ATS segments.
[05:02.2 - 05:11.5] Our non-IFRS adjusted EPS of $2.43 was up 28% versus the prior year, while non-IFRS
[05:11.5 - 05:18.5] operating margin of 5.6% was higher by 70 basis points, with both results marking the
[05:18.5 - 05:21.1] highest in the company's history.
[05:21.1 - 05:26.7] Our strong profitability and working capital management allowed us to generate non-IFRS
[05:26.9 - 05:34.8] free cash flow of $194 million, exceeding our full year target of $150 million.
[05:34.8 - 05:39.9] Before I provide an update on the market outlook for each of our businesses, I would now like
[05:39.9 - 05:44.1] to turn the call over to Mandeep, who will provide further details on our fourth quarter
[05:44.1 - 05:48.6] financial performance and our guidance for the first quarter of 2024.
[05:48.6 - 05:51.0] Mandeep, over to you.
[05:51.0 - 05:52.0] Thank you, Rob.
[05:52.0 - 05:53.8] And good morning, everyone.
[05:53.8 - 05:59.8] Fourth quarter revenue came in at $2.14 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range.
[05:59.8 - 06:05.3] Revenue was up 5% year-over-year, supported by solid growth in our CCS segment, partially
[06:05.3 - 06:09.2] offset by a modest decline in our ATS segment.
[06:09.2 - 06:16.2] Our fourth quarter non-IFRS operating margin of 6.0% was 70 basis points higher year-over-year,
[06:16.2 - 06:19.9] and marked the highest quarterly results in the company's history.
[06:19.9 - 06:24.8] Our margin expansion was driven primarily by higher profitability in both segments,
[06:24.8 - 06:31.9] as a result of improved mix, production efficiencies, and higher volumes in our CCS segment.
[06:31.9 - 06:37.8] Non-IFRS adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.76, exceeding the high
[06:37.8 - 06:39.9] end of our guidance range.
[06:39.9 - 06:44.8] This result was $0.20 higher year-over-year, driven primarily by higher non-IFRS operating
[06:44.8 - 06:50.1] earnings, as well as lower interest costs, a more favorable non-IFRS adjusted effective
[06:50.1 - 06:54.6] tax rate, and lower shares outstanding.
[06:54.6 - 07:00.5] Moving on to our segment performance, ATS revenues in the fourth quarter were $803 million,
[07:00.5 - 07:06.3] down 2% year-over-year, slightly below our expectations of a low single-digit percentage
[07:06.3 - 07:08.2] increase.
[07:08.2 - 07:12.3] The year-over-year decline in ATS segment revenue was driven by demand softness in our
[07:12.3 - 07:17.1] industrial business, primarily as a result of slowing demand in certain programs, as
[07:17.1 - 07:21.3] well as continued demand headwinds in our capital equipment business.
[07:21.3 - 07:25.6] These declines were partially offset by solid performance in our A&E business, which saw
[07:25.6 - 07:30.1] growth of more than 20% compared to the prior year period.
[07:30.1 - 07:36.0] ATS segment revenues accounted for 38% of total revenues in the fourth quarter, compared
[07:36.0 - 07:40.3] to 40% in the same period last year.
[07:40.4 - 07:46.9] Our fourth quarter CCS segment revenue of $1.34 billion was up 10% compared to the prior
[07:46.9 - 07:51.8] year period, driven by very strong growth in our enterprise end market, partially offset
[07:51.8 - 07:55.8] by anticipated demand softness in our communications end market.
[07:55.8 - 08:01.6] CCS segment revenue accounted for 62% of total company revenues in the quarter, compared
[08:01.6 - 08:06.0] to 60% in the prior year period.
[08:06.1 - 08:10.3] Our communications end market revenue in the fourth quarter was up 46% year-over-year,
[08:10.3 - 08:15.0] meaningfully above our expectation of a high 20s percentage increase.
[08:15.0 - 08:20.3] This growth was driven by ramping programs and strengthening demand for AI ML compute
[08:20.3 - 08:23.8] from our hyperscaler customers.
[08:23.8 - 08:28.7] Revenue in our communications end market was lower by 10% compared to the prior year period,
[08:28.7 - 08:33.4] better than our expectation of a mid-teens percentage decrease.
[08:33.4 - 08:37.5] Similar to last quarter, the decline was driven primarily by tough comps, as some of
[08:37.5 - 08:42.3] our customers continue to digest inventory purchased in the prior year.
[08:42.3 - 08:49.3] HPS revenue was $484 million in the quarter, 1% lower year-over-year.
[08:49.3 - 08:54.9] HPS revenues were 23% of total company revenues in the fourth quarter, compared to 24% in
[08:54.9 - 08:58.2] the prior year period.
[08:59.1 - 09:06.9] ATS segment margin in the fourth quarter was 4.7%, up 30 basis points year-over-year, driven
[09:06.9 - 09:10.1] by strong productivity and favorable mix.
[09:10.1 - 09:16.9] BCS segment margin during the quarter was 6.7%, up 80 basis points year-over-year, driven
[09:16.9 - 09:23.9] by higher volumes and improved mix, including significant growth with our hyperscaler customers.
[09:23.9 - 09:28.2] During the fourth quarter, and for 2023, we had one customer which accounted for more
[09:28.2 - 09:34.3] than 10% of total revenues, representing 29% for the quarter and 22% for the year.
[09:34.3 - 09:39.1] Gillespie has a longstanding relationship with this customer, a global hyperscaler that
[09:39.1 - 09:42.3] we have been supporting for well over a decade.
[09:42.3 - 09:48.5] We support this customer across 25 programs, covering HPS and non-HPS products in the areas
[09:48.5 - 09:50.9] of networking and compute.
[09:50.9 - 09:55.6] The products we build are highly complex, and as a result, the majority of these programs
[09:55.6 - 09:56.6] are single-sourced.
[09:56.6 - 10:02.2] In addition, we are pleased that as a result of our strength in engineering and solid operational
[10:02.2 - 10:06.9] execution, we continue to win new programs with this customer and expect to see demand
[10:06.9 - 10:12.4] strength continue through 2024 and into 2025.
[10:12.4 - 10:15.1] Moving on to some additional financial metrics.
[10:15.9 - 10:21.5] IFRS net earnings for the fourth quarter were $84 million, or $0.70 per share, compared
[10:21.5 - 10:28.6] to net earnings of $42 million, or $0.35 per share in the prior year period.
[10:28.6 - 10:34.3] Adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was 10.4%, up 100 basis points year-over-year
[10:34.3 - 10:38.7] due to improved mix and production efficiencies.
[10:38.7 - 10:44.1] Fourth quarter non-IFRS adjusted effective tax rate was 20% in the quarter, compared
[10:44.1 - 10:49.3] to 23% in the prior year period.
[10:49.3 - 10:55.6] Non-IFRS adjusted ROIC for the fourth quarter was 23.3%, an improvement of 2.6% compared
[10:55.6 - 11:02.3] to the prior year quarter, driven by strong profitability and working capital management.
[11:02.3 - 11:04.3] Moving on to working capital.
[11:04.3 - 11:11.4] At the end of the fourth quarter, our inventory balance was $2.11 billion, down $155 million
[11:11.4 - 11:17.0] sequentially, and down $244 million year-over-year.
[11:17.0 - 11:23.1] Cash deposits were $905 million at the end of the fourth quarter, up $30 million sequentially,
[11:23.1 - 11:28.2] and higher by $79 million compared to the prior year period.
[11:28.2 - 11:32.1] When accounting for cash deposits, inventory at the end of the fourth quarter was lower
[11:32.1 - 11:40.9] by $323 million on a year-over-year basis, and lower by $185 million sequentially.
[11:40.9 - 11:45.8] Inventory days, net of cash deposit days, were 62 in the fourth quarter, compared to
[11:45.8 - 11:49.3] 79 in the prior year period.
[11:49.3 - 11:52.7] We are pleased with the improvements we are seeing in inventory, as material constraints
[11:52.7 - 11:58.4] continue to improve and components lead times normalize.
[11:58.4 - 12:02.9] Cash cycle days were 72 during the fourth quarter, flat sequentially, and eight days
[12:02.9 - 12:06.9] higher than the prior year period.
[12:06.9 - 12:12.7] Capital expenditures for the quarter were $33 million, or approximately 1.5% of revenue,
[12:12.7 - 12:17.8] compared with 1.6% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022.
[12:17.8 - 12:24.5] For the full year, capital expenditures were $125 million, or 1.6% of revenue, as we continue
[12:24.5 - 12:29.6] to invest in growth across our network to support customer demand.
[12:29.6 - 12:34.6] As we look to 2024, we expect our capital expenditures to modestly increase to between
[12:34.6 - 12:42.4] 1.75% and 2.25% of revenues, with a higher level of spend in the first half of the year.
[12:42.4 - 12:46.8] Our increasing level of capital expenditures is geared towards capacity expansions at key
[12:46.8 - 12:52.5] sites in support of demand for AIML compute and HPS programs.
[12:52.5 - 12:58.1] In Thailand, we are currently building out over 100,000 square feet of additional capacity,
[12:58.1 - 13:03.0] with the first phase expected to be online in the first quarter of 2024, and the second
[13:03.0 - 13:08.0] phase expected to be completed in the first half of 2025.
[13:08.0 - 13:11.5] This expansion is being partially funded by a co-investment with one of our hyperscaler
[13:11.5 - 13:17.3] customers to facilitate demand for highly specialized data center products.
[13:17.3 - 13:21.8] And in Malaysia, we are building more than 80,000 square feet of capacity to support
[13:21.8 - 13:26.7] strong demand from customers in our CCS segment, including our HPS business.
[13:26.7 - 13:33.2] This addition is expected to be online in the first half of 2024.
[13:33.2 - 13:39.0] Turning to non-IFRS adjusted free cash flow, we generated $84 million in the fourth quarter
[13:39.0 - 13:44.3] compared to $43 million in the prior year period, marking our 20th consecutive quarter
[13:44.3 - 13:48.3] of positive non-IFRS adjusted free cash flow.
[13:48.3 - 13:54.5] This result brings our total free cash flow for the year to $194 million, ahead of our
[13:54.5 - 14:02.2] full year outlook of $150 million, and approximately double our results from 2022 of $94 million.
[14:02.2 - 14:08.1] The outperformance was driven by strong profitability and working capital management.
[14:08.1 - 14:13.9] Looking forward to 2024, we are expecting $200 million or more of non-IFRS adjusted
[14:13.9 - 14:19.5] free cash flow, $25 million higher than the outlook we shared in our November virtual
[14:19.5 - 14:21.7] investor meeting.
[14:21.7 - 14:26.4] Moving on to some additional key metrics, at the end of the fourth quarter, our cash
[14:26.4 - 14:32.3] balance was $370 million, higher by $17 million sequentially.
[14:32.3 - 14:38.4] In combination with our approximately $600 million of borrowing capacity under our revolver,
[14:38.4 - 14:43.7] this provides us with liquidity of approximately $1 billion, which we believe is sufficient
[14:43.7 - 14:47.7] to meet our anticipated business needs.
[14:47.7 - 14:52.9] Our gross debt at the end of the fourth quarter was $609 million, leaving us with a net debt
[14:52.9 - 14:56.8] position of $239 million.
[14:56.8 - 15:02.0] Our fourth quarter gross debt to non-IFRS trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA leverage
[15:02.0 - 15:09.1] ratio was 1.1 turns, flat sequentially, and down 0.2 turns compared to the same period
[15:09.1 - 15:11.9] of last year.
[15:11.9 - 15:17.5] As of December 31st, 2023, we were compliant with all financial covenants under our credit
[15:17.5 - 15:19.9] agreement.
[15:19.9 - 15:25.0] During the fourth quarter, we purchased approximately 400,000 shares for cancellation under our
[15:25.0 - 15:29.1] normal course issuer bid at a cost of $10 million.
[15:29.1 - 15:34.9] For 2023, we repurchased a total of 2.6 million shares for cancellation, or approximately
[15:34.9 - 15:41.9] 2% of our shares outstanding at year end, at a total cost of $36 million.
[15:41.9 - 15:47.2] In December, the TSX accepted our normal course issuer bid, which is in effect until
[15:47.2 - 15:49.4] December 2024.
[15:49.4 - 15:54.8] Under this new NCIB, we are authorized to purchase up to approximately 11.8 million
[15:54.8 - 15:58.8] shares, or approximately 10% of the public float.
[15:58.8 - 16:03.0] We continue to believe that investing in our share buyback program is a good use of capital
[16:03.0 - 16:09.8] and intend to repurchase shares on an opportunistic basis in 2024.
[16:09.8 - 16:13.8] Now turning to our guidance for the first quarter of 2024.
[16:13.8 - 16:21.2] First quarter revenues are expected to be in the range of $2.025 billion to $2.175 billion,
[16:21.2 - 16:26.6] which if the midpoint of this range is achieved, would represent growth of 14% compared to
[16:26.6 - 16:29.3] the prior year period.
[16:29.3 - 16:35.0] First quarter non-IFRS adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of 67
[16:35.0 - 16:41.5] to 77 cents per share, which at the midpoint would represent an improvement of 25 cents
[16:41.5 - 16:48.1] per share, or 53% compared to the first quarter of 2023.
[16:48.1 - 16:53.1] If the midpoint of our revenue and non-IFRS adjusted EPS guidance ranges are achieved,
[16:53.1 - 16:59.6] non-IFRS operating margin would be 6.0%, which would represent an increase of 80 basis points
[16:59.6 - 17:00.5] over the same period.
[17:00.5 - 17:06.8] last year. Non-IFRS adjusted SG&A expense for the first quarter is expected to be in
[17:06.8 - 17:15.1] the range of $62 to $64 million. We anticipate our non-IFRS adjusted effective tax rate to
[17:15.1 - 17:19.7] be approximately 20% for the first quarter, excluding any impact from taxable foreign
[17:19.7 - 17:25.6] exchange or unanticipated tax settlements. Our first quarter guidance assumes that our
[17:25.6 - 17:30.4] income will be subject to global minimum tax, as legislation that has been introduced
[17:30.4 - 17:36.1] in Canada may be approved before the end of the quarter. If this legislation is not substantially
[17:36.1 - 17:40.9] enacted in the first quarter, our estimate for our first quarter non-IFRS adjusted effective
[17:40.9 - 17:47.6] tax rate would be approximately 15%. Now turning to our end market outlook for the
[17:47.6 - 17:54.3] first quarter of 2024. In our ATS segment, we anticipate revenue to be down in the low
[17:54.3 - 17:59.0] single-digit percentage range year-over-year, driven by demand softness in our industrial
[17:59.0 - 18:05.1] business and ongoing market softness in capital equipment, partly offset by continued growth
[18:05.1 - 18:11.2] in A&E. We anticipate revenues in our communications end market to be up in the low single-digit
[18:11.2 - 18:16.1] percentage range year-over-year, driven by strengthening demand and networking from hyperscaler
[18:16.1 - 18:22.1] customers, including in our HPS programs. Finally, in our enterprise end market, we
[18:22.1 - 18:28.2] expect revenue to be up in the high 60s percentage range year-over-year, driven by anticipated
[18:28.2 - 18:35.3] demand growth in AIML compute programs from our hyperscaler customers. I'll now turn the
[18:35.3 - 18:39.4] call back over to Rob to discuss the outlook for each of our end markets and the overall
[18:39.4 - 18:40.4] business.
[18:40.4 - 18:45.8] Thank you, Mandy. Before discussing the outlook for our markets, I would like to reaffirm
[18:45.8 - 18:51.3] the following metrics from our 2024 financial outlook that we provided at our virtual investor
[18:51.3 - 18:58.9] meeting in November. We continue to expect revenue of $8.5 billion or more, non-IFRS
[18:58.9 - 19:06.9] adjusted EPS of $2.70 or more, and non-IFRS operating margin to be in the range of 5.5
[19:06.9 - 19:13.7] to 6%. In addition, as Mandeep mentioned, we have raised our non-IFRS free cash flow
[19:13.7 - 19:20.0] outlook for the year to $200 million or more. We are pleased with our strong performance
[19:20.0 - 19:27.7] in 2023 and continue to see very positive momentum in the first quarter of 2024. As
[19:27.7 - 19:32.7] such, we are currently undertaking discussions with our customers and suppliers in order
[19:32.7 - 19:38.0] to obtain better visibility into the remainder of the year. And we look forward to providing
[19:38.0 - 19:44.1] an update on our 2024 outlook with our first quarter results.
[19:44.1 - 19:51.3] Now moving on to the outlook for each of our businesses. Beginning with our ATS segment,
[19:51.3 - 19:58.1] our industrial business recorded annual growth of 29% in 2023, driven by ramping programs
[19:58.1 - 20:04.7] in smart energy and EV charging. However, we began to see signs of market softness towards
[20:04.7 - 20:10.2] the end of the year, due in part to pockets of weakness in the broader economic environment,
[20:10.2 - 20:15.7] higher interest rates, as well as some delays in new program ramps. As such, we expect to
[20:15.7 - 20:20.9] see lower revenues in our industrial portfolio through the first half of the year before
[20:20.9 - 20:26.2] seeing a return to year-to-year growth in the second half, which should result in modest
[20:26.2 - 20:34.1] growth in our industrial business for all of 2024 when compared to 2023. We continue
[20:34.1 - 20:40.5] to believe that the structural trends in markets such as EV charging, smart energy, and telematics,
[20:40.5 - 20:46.0] amongst others, remain intact and are supportive to growth in our industrial business over the
[20:46.0 - 20:52.2] long term. In our A&E business, the sustained recovery in commercial aerospace has seen
[20:52.2 - 20:58.7] domestic air travel surpass pre-pandemic levels in many economies, resulting in annual revenue
[20:58.7 - 21:06.7] growth of more than 30% in 2023 compared to 2022. Looking ahead, we expect to see strong
[21:06.7 - 21:14.3] demand across our commercial aerospace submarkets to continue in 2024. Our defense business is also
[21:14.3 - 21:20.0] expected to see solid growth in the year ahead, supported by new program wins and increased
[21:20.0 - 21:26.9] government investment in military capabilities. Overall, we anticipate the solid demand to drive
[21:26.9 - 21:32.7] low double-digit percentage growth in our A&E business in 2024 compared to 2023.
[21:33.7 - 21:38.5] In our capital equipment business, market forecasts continue to suggest that the underlying
[21:38.5 - 21:44.3] market demand is operating close to trough levels, and we should see flat to slightly higher demand
[21:44.3 - 21:50.6] in 2024. We are maintaining our outlook for modest revenue growth in our capital equipment business
[21:50.6 - 21:56.7] in 2024, supported by the ramping of new program wins and our assumption of base demand holding
[21:56.7 - 22:03.4] flat for 2023. We anticipate that the year-to-year growth will largely be in the back half of the
[22:03.4 - 22:11.3] year, setting up for a stronger recovery in demand in 2025. In our health tech business,
[22:11.3 - 22:18.1] we anticipate our revenue to grow in 2024 compared to 2023 as we ramp new programs.
[22:20.4 - 22:26.0] So, for our overall APS segment, we currently anticipate that revenue will decline slightly
[22:26.0 - 22:32.9] in the first half of 2024 compared to 2023 due to pockets of macro weakness affecting some of
[22:32.9 - 22:39.0] our markets. However, we anticipate that segment revenue will resume year-to-year growth in the
[22:39.0 - 22:45.6] second half of the year. Overall, we are maintaining our expectation for APS revenue growth in the
[22:45.6 - 22:53.3] mid-single-digit percentage range in 2024. Now, turning to our CCS segment, the demand backdrop
[22:53.3 - 22:59.0] for our CCS segment continues to be very strong. Investments from hyperscalers and data center
[22:59.0 - 23:04.6] infrastructure are fueling significant CapEx spending, driven by growing demand for artificial
[23:04.6 - 23:11.3] intelligence and machine learning applications. In 2023, our portfolio with our hyperscalers saw
[23:11.3 - 23:20.1] revenue growth of 32% compared to 2022, recording nearly $2.9 billion in revenues. This accounted
[23:20.1 - 23:29.3] for 62% of our total CCS segment revenues in 2023, up from 51% the prior year. At our recent
[23:29.3 - 23:34.8] virtual investor meeting in November, we delved further into this dynamic, which we believe is
[23:34.8 - 23:42.4] long-term and structural in nature. We anticipate this solid growth to continue in 2024 and believe
[23:42.4 - 23:47.8] that this investment cycle has the potential to support several years of strong demand for our
[23:47.8 - 23:54.6] CCS segment. The demand outlook for our enterprise-end market continues to be impressive
[23:55.2 - 24:00.2] as a beneficiary of hyperscalers' growing deployment of AI ML compute capacity.
[24:01.3 - 24:07.7] We're seeing the strong momentum from 2023 continue, and as mentioned earlier, we anticipate
[24:07.7 - 24:16.1] significant growth within our AI ML compute portfolio as we enter 2024. We expect additional
[24:16.1 - 24:21.2] growth in our storage business to materialize in the latter half of the year, driven by demand
[24:21.2 - 24:29.6] from new programs. After experiencing some softness in 2023, demand in our communications-end market
[24:29.6 - 24:34.7] is anticipated to resume year-to-year growth in the first quarter, driven by a resumption of
[24:34.7 - 24:40.2] strength in networking demand from hyperscalers, which is expected to persist throughout the year.
[24:40.9 - 24:47.1] Within our HBS business, we anticipate to resume year-to-year growth in the first quarter of 2024
[24:47.7 - 24:53.5] and for the full year. This growth is being fueled by a number of new program wins in both networking,
[24:53.5 - 24:59.3] supported by growth in our 400G and 800G platforms, and to some extent, AI ML compute.
[25:00.8 - 25:06.4] For 2024, we are maintaining our previously communicated expectation of low double-digit
[25:06.5 - 25:13.7] percentage revenue growth in our CCS segment, supported by solid growth in both our enterprise
[25:13.7 - 25:18.6] and communications-end markets. Although we are seeing some divergence in the short-term
[25:18.6 - 25:23.7] demand dynamics underlying our various end markets, we believe that the fundamentals
[25:23.7 - 25:28.1] supporting our overall business are very constructive due to the benefits of our
[25:28.1 - 25:34.9] strategic portfolio diversification and our consistent execution. We feel that our positioning
[25:34.9 - 25:42.1] for 2024 remains positive as we remain confident in our ability to meet our financial outlook and
[25:42.1 - 25:49.0] improve on our very strong performance in 2023. With that, I would now like to turn the call over
[25:49.0 - 25:58.5] to the operator for questions. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin
[25:58.5 - 26:04.0] the question and answer session. Should you have a question, please press star, followed by the
[26:04.0 - 26:09.7] number one on your touchtone phone. You will hear a three-tone prompt acknowledging your request.
[26:09.7 - 26:14.4] Should you wish to decline from the polling process, please press star, followed by the number two.
[26:15.1 - 26:19.3] If you are using a speakerphone, please lift your hands up before pressing any key.
[26:21.4 - 26:26.6] Our first question comes from the line of Robert Young from Canaccord Denuity. Please go ahead.
[26:27.6 - 26:34.0] Hi. Can you give us a little bit of color on the hyperscale business and CCS given the large
[26:34.0 - 26:40.1] customer accounting for 29%? It's a pretty significant chunk. Maybe if you could talk about
[26:40.1 - 26:46.9] the business outside of that large customer. Is that driven by the high level of AI compute
[26:46.9 - 26:50.4] currently and there's one customer or a small number of customers there, or is there some other
[26:50.9 - 26:57.6] dynamic going on there? Hi, Rob. With this particular customer,
[26:58.3 - 27:03.7] it's a hyperscale customer. They're making significant investments in AI, ML compute,
[27:04.4 - 27:10.5] as well as networking. As you mentioned on the call, we have over 25 programs with this customer
[27:10.5 - 27:17.0] and it's comprised of everything from hardware platform solutions to high value EMS to even
[27:17.0 - 27:22.9] services. They're an industry leader. We've been doing business with them for over a decade
[27:23.8 - 27:31.7] and they're also co-investing with us on some CapEx facility investments over in Thailand,
[27:31.7 - 27:38.3] so a very healthy relationship. Across the broader hyperscaler business, we're also seeing
[27:39.1 - 27:45.8] strong growth from several others in the same area and we expect the concentration to improve
[27:45.8 - 27:52.7] over time as it flows into people's investment cycles. I would just add to that, Rob, that as a
[27:52.7 - 27:57.8] reminder, we do business with the top five hyperscalers and while we are doing a lot of AI
[27:57.8 - 28:03.0] and ML compute with the large customer that Rob just talked about, we're starting to see some
[28:03.0 - 28:07.6] return in demand coming on the networking side, which is helping us across the customer base.
[28:08.1 - 28:12.1] We're really encouraged that as we go into the first quarter now, we're seeing growth resume
[28:12.1 - 28:16.9] in communications, we're seeing growth resume in hardware platform solutions and those are
[28:16.9 - 28:22.9] offerings that we provide across the customer base. Okay, thank you. And then the second question,
[28:22.9 - 28:26.9] maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. You said you're going to revisit the full year outlook,
[28:26.9 - 28:33.3] I think in Q1, but the outlook for five and a half to six percent operating margin seems
[28:33.3 - 28:42.5] conservative given you're doing so well in the enterprise business in CCS at 6.7% and you're
[28:42.5 - 28:48.4] entering at 6% and the guide looks like 6%. So, it looks as though it's going to decelerate in
[28:48.4 - 28:55.3] the back half of the year. Maybe we can discuss that and I'll pass the line. Yeah, Rob, I'll talk
[28:55.3 - 28:59.5] about two things. One is the outlook for the full year and then I can talk to your point on margin
[28:59.5 - 29:05.5] specifically. So, when we look at full year 2024, we're really pleased with the way we ran to 2023
[29:05.5 - 29:10.4] and clearly, we're off to a really hot start now into the first quarter and again, encouraged by
[29:10.4 - 29:15.9] where we're seeing the demand signals come through both on comps and HPS, but also the demand signals
[29:15.9 - 29:21.3] from the hyperscalers continue to strengthen. As you know, in November, we provided the outlook
[29:21.3 - 29:27.0] of eight and a half billion or more and $2.70 of EPS or more and right now, we really do see that
[29:27.0 - 29:32.2] as being the floor. What we are looking to do, as Rob mentioned in his prepared remarks, is we're
[29:32.2 - 29:37.3] going back out to the customer base and revalidating the second half outlook. We're seeing
[29:37.3 - 29:40.9] that increased strength happening in the first half and now, what we want to do is go and validate
[29:40.9 - 29:46.5] whether or not those increasing level of demand signals are going to be added to the second half
[29:46.5 - 29:50.8] as well. So, in April, we'll come back with an updated forecast. To your point on the margin
[29:50.8 - 29:56.8] profile itself, as we talked about, HPS is expected to see some very minor levels of
[29:56.8 - 30:00.3] declines in the first half of this year before resuming growth in the back end of the year.
[30:00.3 - 30:04.9] HPS, again, we're expecting across all of our end markets to have some level of growth in 2024,
[30:04.9 - 30:09.1] but because that growth in the back half is going to be off the back of ramping programs,
[30:09.1 - 30:14.1] there is going to be a little bit of margin challenges around there as well. Again, 6%
[30:14.1 - 30:19.3] for the first quarter, I believe the $2.70 is the floor and obviously, we're going to be working
[30:19.3 - 30:24.9] towards the high end of that 5.5% to 6% range as best we can. And one other thing I would add,
[30:24.9 - 30:28.6] Rob, I think by the end of the first quarter, we'll have better visibility into
[30:29.7 - 30:36.9] capital equipment markets. We are seeing some signs of recovery. We're cautiously optimistic.
[30:37.4 - 30:42.1] Some of our customers are starting to restock consumables and spares, which is a good sign. So,
[30:42.1 - 30:47.1] I think as capital equipment gets better, so will some of the ATS margins as well.
[30:47.7 - 30:50.1] Okay. Thank you. I'll pass the line.
[30:53.5 - 30:59.8] Thank you. We have our next question coming from the line of Maxim Matyshansky from RBC Capital
[30:59.8 - 31:04.6] Markets. Please go ahead. Hi. Good morning. Just on the
[31:04.6 - 31:11.2] communications segment, has there been any changes to your expectation for the networking growth to
[31:11.2 - 31:18.0] resume in Q1? Or is it just the OEM business that's offsetting the hyperscaler strength? I
[31:18.0 - 31:23.2] think I see that the guidance implies a quarter-by-quarter deceleration. So, is that
[31:23.2 - 31:28.1] to mean that that is primarily because of the OEM business softness?
[31:29.5 - 31:34.9] No. As we head into Q1, we expect communications and networking to actually be up,
[31:35.7 - 31:47.8] driven by hyperscalers, both on 400G and 800G programs. And there's also HPS-driven programs.
[31:47.8 - 31:53.4] So, as we head into last year, we had some tough comps. Some of those tough comps are
[31:53.4 - 31:56.1] lapsing, and now we're seeing comps return to growth.
[31:56.7 - 32:03.5] Got it. And on the hyperscalers, are there any changes from your last update, I guess, in November
[32:03.5 - 32:09.3] on your hyperscaler customer programs and your expected demand over the next few quarters?
[32:10.3 - 32:16.5] And you talked about a new program wins with your largest customer. Is that something that
[32:16.5 - 32:19.7] you anticipated in previous quarters? Is that something that's new?
[32:19.7 - 32:26.6] Yeah. On our hyperscaler programs, we've actually been winning incremental share. That on top of
[32:26.6 - 32:32.8] increased demand strength has both been positive for us and some of the reasons for some of the
[32:32.8 - 32:37.6] improved outlook that we're seeing into Q1 and potentially for the full year. Hence, that's why
[32:37.6 - 32:42.8] we're going to take a quarter to revisit with our customers and take a look at what the full year
[32:42.8 - 32:48.0] has to be. But we have been winning incremental share. We've actually been winning incremental
[32:48.1 - 32:50.1] share. That's why we're going to take a quarter to revisit with our customers and take a look at what
[32:50.1 - 32:54.9] the full year has to be. But we have been winning some incremental share and been booking a really
[32:54.9 - 33:01.4] significant amount of 800G programs. And just a final one for me, just to revisit
[33:01.4 - 33:06.9] ATS. I think some of your peers have also been seeing a slowdown in their end markets over the
[33:06.9 - 33:13.5] last little bit based on customers working through their inventory buffers. Is that what you're seeing
[33:13.5 - 33:19.7] as well this quarter? And can you maybe speak to, within industrial and capital equipment and
[33:19.7 - 33:27.1] markets specifically, what is causing you to expect demand to return by the second half? Is it
[33:27.1 - 33:33.4] primarily those new program ramps? Yeah. Good question. So our industrial business in 2023,
[33:34.9 - 33:39.6] our waiver minder grew close to 30%. Again, it was fueled by green energy programs,
[33:39.6 - 33:45.2] including EV charging, energy storage, energy generation. As we're exiting the year, demand
[33:45.2 - 33:50.1] started sliding down in some of these markets. And the markets that were really impacted were
[33:50.1 - 33:56.1] interest rate sensitive markets. But moreover, because the material environment has dramatically
[33:56.1 - 34:00.8] improved, our customers were taking the opportunity to reduce their strategic inventory buffers.
[34:00.9 - 34:05.6] We think those buffers will normalize in the first half of the year and in the second half
[34:05.6 - 34:11.4] of the year we have new programs, ramps planned, which would return the industrial business
[34:11.4 - 34:12.4] to growth.
[34:12.4 - 34:17.6] In our capital equipment business, as I mentioned earlier, we're cautiously optimistic as we
[34:17.6 - 34:22.3] get to the back half of the year and certainly into 2025 that we're seeing some signs of
[34:22.3 - 34:23.3] growth.
[34:23.3 - 34:29.6] And the costs are pretty much aligned there and, again, we're seeing some spares orders.
[34:29.6 - 34:32.8] And as a reminder, some of the headwinds that we're seeing in ATS we think will be more
[34:32.8 - 34:37.6] than offset with our strength that we're seeing in our CCS business.
[34:37.6 - 34:38.6] Great.
[34:38.6 - 34:43.0] Thanks, LaPaz Lyon.
[34:43.0 - 34:44.0] Thank you.
[34:44.0 - 34:48.9] We have our next question coming from the line of Thanas Mastropoulos from YAML Capital
[34:48.9 - 34:49.9] Markets.
[34:49.9 - 34:50.9] Please go ahead.
[34:50.9 - 34:51.9] Hi.
[34:51.9 - 34:52.9] Good morning.
[34:52.9 - 34:57.6] With respect to the full year guidance, I hear you with respect to wanting to discuss
[34:57.7 - 35:03.7] the second half outlook with your customers before revisiting the guidance.
[35:03.7 - 35:08.0] But certainly from the demand signals you're highlighting, it seems like it'll be a stronger
[35:08.0 - 35:09.0] second half.
[35:09.0 - 35:13.3] I guess from your perspective, what might be the key areas of uncertainty you want to
[35:13.3 - 35:15.5] get further color on before visiting guidance?
[35:15.5 - 35:20.7] Would that be on semi and industrial or which areas would be the biggest source of demand
[35:20.7 - 35:22.7] variability as you think about the second half?
[35:22.7 - 35:23.7] Yeah.
[35:23.7 - 35:24.7] Hi, Thanas.
[35:24.7 - 35:25.7] Mandeep here.
[35:26.5 - 35:30.2] We were pleased to be able to interlock with our customer base specifically on the hyperscaler
[35:30.2 - 35:32.5] side in the fourth quarter.
[35:32.5 - 35:36.5] And that has led us to confidently come out with the outlook that we did.
[35:36.5 - 35:41.8] Even after our virtual investor meeting in November, we saw incremental improvements
[35:41.8 - 35:44.0] to the forecast coming from the hyperscalers.
[35:44.0 - 35:46.0] And so that's reflected in our Q1 guidance.
[35:46.0 - 35:51.7] Again, our outlook is for 14% year-over-year growth, which is higher than what we would
[35:51.7 - 35:53.6] have said probably in November.
[35:53.6 - 35:56.3] And we're seeing that demand strength continue into the second quarter.
[35:56.3 - 36:00.7] So the conversations with the hyperscalers are, is there an improvement in material availability
[36:00.7 - 36:01.7] on your end?
[36:01.7 - 36:06.6] Has your deployment plans changed at all?
[36:06.6 - 36:08.7] And how does that impact the second half of the year?
[36:08.7 - 36:12.1] Is it going to be similar to what we're seeing right now in the first half of the year?
[36:12.1 - 36:15.7] And then to Rob's point on capital equipment, so our assumption right now is that the base
[36:15.7 - 36:18.2] market is going to be flat.
[36:18.2 - 36:22.9] We're around trough levels right now, some encouraging signs, as Rob talked about.
[36:22.9 - 36:27.0] And where we're expecting the growth to be in capital equipment is as we ramp ASML.
[36:27.0 - 36:30.8] ASML is a customer of ours for a few years now, but we've won a number of programs over
[36:30.8 - 36:32.2] the last year or so.
[36:32.2 - 36:34.9] And those programs are in the process of being ramped right now.
[36:34.9 - 36:39.0] And the demand signals from that specific customer have not changed.
[36:39.0 - 36:42.4] And so what we're looking to do as we go to the rest of the customer base in capital equipment
[36:42.4 - 36:46.4] is to understand whether or not some of these early signs that we're seeing in terms of
[36:46.4 - 36:51.4] consumables and spares is going to lead to a demand uptick in the back end of the year.
[36:51.5 - 36:54.0] And so it's really around hyperscalers and capital equipment.
[36:54.0 - 36:56.0] That's helpful.
[36:56.0 - 37:01.9] And then on the softness in industrial, just to clarify, is that primarily weighted in
[37:01.9 - 37:07.4] green energy or is that kind of across the board in your various markets in industrial?
[37:07.4 - 37:16.9] It's pronounced mostly in EV charging, which is kind of being driven by a slowdown in EV
[37:16.9 - 37:23.5] sales and also some of the incentives, at least in the U.S., are slow to get out to
[37:23.5 - 37:24.5] the marketplace.
[37:24.5 - 37:27.9] That's having some impact as well as the higher interest rates.
[37:27.9 - 37:32.4] But we're also seeing a little bit of a slowdown in I'll call it the broader industrial space
[37:32.4 - 37:36.2] just driven by the burndown of strategic inventory buffers.
[37:36.2 - 37:42.6] Again, we expect some new program ramps and the burndown of the buffers for this entire
[37:42.6 - 37:45.9] industrial business to start resuming to growth in the back half of the year.
[37:45.9 - 37:46.9] Great.
[37:46.9 - 37:47.9] I'll pass the line.
[37:47.9 - 37:48.9] Thanks.
[37:48.9 - 37:49.9] Thanks.
[37:49.9 - 37:50.9] Thank you.
[37:50.9 - 37:57.9] We have our next question coming from the line of Daniel Chan from TD Securities.
[37:57.9 - 37:58.9] Please go ahead.
[37:58.9 - 37:59.9] Hi.
[37:59.9 - 38:00.9] Good morning.
[38:00.9 - 38:01.9] Congrats on the strong quarter here.
[38:01.9 - 38:05.9] So communications was stronger than expected this quarter.
[38:05.9 - 38:10.9] Was that driven by AI demand strength or was that from non-AI related cloud demand where
[38:11.2 - 38:14.2] we're also starting to see some early signs of a recovery?
[38:14.2 - 38:22.2] In terms of comms, it was driven by networking, which is kind of the pull through that we've
[38:22.2 - 38:27.2] been mentioning that we would see as a result of AI ML demand.
[38:27.2 - 38:34.2] And within networking, there's I'll call it AI ML networking, which is directly driven
[38:34.2 - 38:37.2] and we've seen growth in those programs.
[38:37.2 - 38:40.2] Networking comes in a couple of different flavors.
[38:40.6 - 38:44.6] I think the growth is really driven by some of the AI ML applications and we've certainly
[38:44.6 - 38:46.6] seen an uptick in that.
[38:48.6 - 38:51.6] And then we've seen a lot of new data center leasing activity.
[38:51.6 - 38:57.6] So just curious on the timing of this communications ramp as you guys are expecting 800G to ramp
[38:57.6 - 38:59.6] into 2025.
[38:59.6 - 39:03.6] So with all these new data centers coming online, are these new builds going to have
[39:03.6 - 39:07.6] 800G in them or will they leverage 400G to begin with?
[39:07.9 - 39:11.9] So just wondering like with them building out all these new data centers this year,
[39:12.9 - 39:15.9] whether they're going to be putting a lot of that next generation stuff or where they're
[39:15.9 - 39:17.9] going with current generation equipment?
[39:18.9 - 39:20.9] That's a good question.
[39:21.9 - 39:26.9] What I can tell you is that 400G is strong throughout the year.
[39:26.9 - 39:31.9] 800G is starting to ramp in the first half of the year, very strong in the back half
[39:31.9 - 39:34.9] of the year and certainly picking up into 2025.
[39:35.2 - 39:40.2] That would lead me to believe it's a little bit of a blend, but to be frank with you,
[39:40.2 - 39:41.2] I'm not entirely sure.
[39:42.2 - 39:46.2] One of the things that we are seeing, Dan, is that within some of our customers' CapEx
[39:46.2 - 39:52.2] spending, they are shifting CapEx towards AI applications and so making a decision to
[39:52.2 - 39:54.2] refresh certain data centers over other data centers.
[39:55.2 - 40:01.2] In addition to that, what we're also seeing is that for some of the customers, as Silicon
[40:01.5 - 40:07.5] becomes available, they're looking for 400G solutions while they wait for 800G to be available
[40:07.5 - 40:10.5] in 2025 as it goes through the design cycle, etc.
[40:11.5 - 40:16.5] So we are seeing a shift of investment towards AI applications and sometimes that's at the
[40:16.5 - 40:18.5] expense of more traditional cloud applications.
[40:20.5 - 40:21.5] Appreciate it. Thanks for that.
[40:22.5 - 40:26.5] And the final question, you also mentioned the ramp up of some of these sites.
[40:26.8 - 40:31.8] Just wondering whether you have enough capacity to deal with the near-term demand that's coming
[40:31.8 - 40:39.8] in throughout this year and how those discussions are going on your ability to service some
[40:39.8 - 40:40.8] of that demand. Thank you.
[40:41.8 - 40:42.8] Yeah, thanks.
[40:42.8 - 40:48.8] We've been interlocking with our customers and been investing forward on capacity expansions,
[40:48.8 - 40:50.8] mainly in Thailand.
[40:51.2 - 40:58.2] We have a couple of phases and also in Malaysia, a phase is coming online in February, ribbon
[40:58.2 - 40:59.2] cutting, frankly.
[41:00.2 - 41:05.2] So yes, we do have enough capacity and it's coming online very much aligned with the demand
[41:05.2 - 41:06.2] state, I would say.
[41:07.2 - 41:12.2] And these are also highly automated factories, highly automated test centers, so they're
[41:12.2 - 41:14.2] really producing a lot of productivity.
[41:15.2 - 41:16.2] Great, thanks.
[41:16.5 - 41:17.5] Thank you.
[41:18.5 - 41:22.5] We have our next question coming from the line of Matt Sheeran from Steeple.
[41:23.5 - 41:24.5] Please go ahead.
[41:25.5 - 41:26.5] Yes, thank you.
[41:26.5 - 41:27.5] Good morning.
[41:28.5 - 41:35.5] My first question, just wanted to go circle back to the guidance for CCS and understanding
[41:36.5 - 41:39.5] sort of lack of visibility into the back half.
[41:39.8 - 41:42.8] But just looking to Q2, I know you have some visibility.
[41:43.8 - 41:47.8] Obviously, you're going to be up in enterprise high 60s year over year.
[41:48.8 - 41:52.8] And I know there's a lot of lumpiness in that business where you're up double digits, one
[41:52.8 - 41:54.8] quarter, and then there's a digestion period.
[41:55.8 - 41:59.8] And so what should we think about, Mandeep, in terms of modeling at least sort of the
[41:59.8 - 42:02.8] first half into Q3 in terms of seasonality?
[42:03.8 - 42:05.8] And obviously, there's not a lot of seasonality.
[42:06.1 - 42:07.1] It's different.
[42:07.1 - 42:09.1] But how should we think about that, the cadence there?
[42:10.1 - 42:11.1] Yeah.
[42:11.1 - 42:12.1] Good morning, Matt.
[42:13.1 - 42:18.1] So we do have, from our legacy OEM accounts, a little bit of seasonality in our first quarter.
[42:19.1 - 42:22.1] And as such, I think you can think about the first quarter revenue number being the low
[42:22.1 - 42:23.1] point for the year.
[42:24.1 - 42:27.1] We are looking for sequential improvement as we go into the second quarter.
[42:28.1 - 42:32.1] And then again, just wanted to maybe clarify some of the wording.
[42:32.4 - 42:36.4] We do have an interlock with our customer base in the back half of the year.
[42:37.4 - 42:42.4] And that interlock gives us the confidence to be able to say the outlook that we're giving,
[42:43.4 - 42:46.4] which is right now we believe the $8.5 billion should be the floor.
[42:47.4 - 42:51.4] What we have seen, though, is that after the interlock, requests from customers to say,
[42:52.4 - 42:53.4] can you give me actually more product?
[42:54.4 - 42:56.4] And can you give it to me sooner than what I had originally asked for?
[42:57.4 - 42:59.4] And so that's what's filling in right now Q1 and Q2.
[42:59.8 - 43:03.8] And so the conversations with the customers are around, have you changed your outlook
[43:04.8 - 43:05.8] for the back half of the year?
[43:06.8 - 43:07.8] And what's driving that?
[43:08.8 - 43:09.8] Is it because you're accelerating data center deployments?
[43:10.8 - 43:14.8] Is it because there is a better level of availability, which is happening?
[43:15.8 - 43:18.8] And then how does that impact the last two quarters, the way it's impacting the first
[43:19.8 - 43:20.8] two quarters?
[43:21.8 - 43:23.8] So positive conversations, for sure.
[43:24.8 - 43:25.8] And we do have a level of visibility.
[43:26.8 - 43:27.8] It's really important.
[43:28.1 - 43:31.1] The only level of visibility is to really see if we can increase the numbers or not.
[43:34.1 - 43:38.1] So based on that, would you expect the Q2 to be up sequentially then again?
[43:39.1 - 43:40.1] On a revenue basis, yes.
[43:42.1 - 43:43.1] What's that?
[43:44.1 - 43:46.1] Yes, we would expect higher revenues in Q2 than we do in Q1.
[43:47.1 - 43:48.1] From CCS.
[43:49.1 - 43:50.1] Okay, perfect.
[43:51.1 - 43:56.1] And then the capacity ads in Thailand and Malaysia, Rob, could you give us a ballpark
[43:56.4 - 44:01.4] in terms of the revenue of production capacity in each of those or combined?
[44:02.4 - 44:10.4] And is that incremental revenue where basically new programs or new capacity versus shifting
[44:11.4 - 44:12.4] from another region?
[44:13.4 - 44:21.4] What I can tell you, Matt, is how much square foot we're adding and that the capacity
[44:22.4 - 44:23.4] improvements are a couple of fold.
[44:23.7 - 44:30.7] One, the phase one, if you will, which is coming online this quarter, is about 28,000
[44:31.7 - 44:32.7] square feet of manufacturing space.
[44:33.7 - 44:38.7] It's really a AIML testing facility.
[44:39.7 - 44:44.7] So it's a test farm, a fully automated test farm for all AIML products.
[44:45.7 - 44:47.7] So that's coming online right about now.
[44:48.7 - 44:51.7] And then phase two will be the first half of 2025.
[44:52.0 - 44:57.0] And that's a combined productivity play where we're combining all our warehousing
[44:58.0 - 45:03.0] in Thailand into one facility to save on space and drive productivity.
[45:04.0 - 45:10.0] And also adding about 150,000, I mean 130,000 plus of manufacturing space, which
[45:11.0 - 45:15.0] is going to support existing and new customers as well, largely run AIML.
[45:16.0 - 45:21.0] And we think those capacity expansions should take care of us through the next couple
[45:22.0 - 45:23.0] of years.
[45:24.0 - 45:25.0] Okay.
[45:25.0 - 45:30.0] And just lastly, Mandeep, you talked about you basically increased your cash flow
[45:31.0 - 45:34.0] guidance for the year while keeping everything else intact.
[45:35.0 - 45:36.0] What are the reasons for that?
[45:37.0 - 45:40.0] Is that a function of the inventory reduction and working capital reduction
[45:41.0 - 45:43.0] and the cash flows from that or anything else?
[45:44.0 - 45:45.0] Yeah.
[45:45.0 - 45:48.0] So we continue to be encouraged that the material environment is stabilizing
[45:49.0 - 45:50.0] and improving.
[45:50.4 - 45:53.4] We're seeing lead times right now, not necessarily at pre-pandemic levels
[45:54.4 - 45:57.4] for both passes and semis, but we are seeing them drop pretty close
[45:58.4 - 46:00.4] to that level and they've been improving quarter to quarter.
[46:01.4 - 46:02.4] We have been unwinding inventory as a result.
[46:03.4 - 46:06.4] So we're pleased that we're able to reduce some of that cash.
[46:07.4 - 46:10.4] Really strong fish 2023, $194 million.
[46:11.4 - 46:14.4] We believe that that is the right goal as a minimum for next year
[46:14.7 - 46:17.7] on the back of increasing profitability and inventory environment
[46:18.7 - 46:20.7] that we think is going to continue to improve.
[46:21.7 - 46:24.7] And so we think the goal of $200 billion or more
[46:25.7 - 46:28.7] reflects a good level of conversion and is the right target at this time.
[46:29.7 - 46:30.7] Okay.
[46:30.7 - 46:31.7] Thank you.
[46:32.7 - 46:33.7] Thanks, Matt.
[46:34.7 - 46:35.7] Thank you.
[46:36.7 - 46:39.7] We have our next question coming from the line of Todd Copeland
[46:40.7 - 46:41.7] from CIBC.
[46:42.7 - 46:43.7] Please go ahead.
[46:44.7 - 46:45.7] Great.
[46:46.7 - 46:47.7] Thanks and good morning, everyone.
[46:48.7 - 46:50.7] I want to step back from these detailed questions
[46:51.7 - 46:53.7] and just ask a question on the hyperscaler market,
[46:54.7 - 46:56.7] the global data center market.
[46:57.7 - 47:01.7] What's your view on how much of the data center hyperscaler market
[47:02.7 - 47:06.7] has been upgraded to support generative AI
[47:07.7 - 47:09.7] and large language model processing needs?
[47:10.7 - 47:13.7] How far into that cycle would you think we are at this point?
[47:14.7 - 47:15.7] Good morning, Todd.
[47:16.7 - 47:18.7] That's a very good question.
[47:19.7 - 47:24.7] I would say we're still in the early innings of the upgrade cycle.
[47:25.7 - 47:32.7] And I say that by the fact that it just started about a year or so ago
[47:33.7 - 47:39.7] and given the amount of compute which makes up about 50% of any data center
[47:40.7 - 47:41.7] that needs to kind of get upgraded,
[47:42.0 - 47:46.0] I think we're still in the very early innings of that upgrade cycle.
[47:47.0 - 47:52.0] And the customers in terms of their cycles to get that upgraded
[47:53.0 - 47:57.0] a little bit longer than the quarter-to-quarter discussions,
[47:58.0 - 48:00.0] it's obviously going to be demand dependent,
[48:01.0 - 48:04.0] but is that a two-year process, a five-year process?
[48:05.0 - 48:08.0] What's the mindset towards getting that upgrade complete?
[48:08.3 - 48:12.3] My sense is it's a multi-year process.
[48:13.3 - 48:14.3] It's certainly five plus years.
[48:15.3 - 48:19.3] And again, across each of the hyperscalers that we're dealing with,
[48:20.3 - 48:24.3] they'll each have different appetites and different phases for deployment.
[48:25.3 - 48:27.3] So they won't necessarily all overlap at once,
[48:28.3 - 48:31.3] which for at least for Celestica should give us many years of growth.
[48:32.3 - 48:34.3] Yeah, I would add to that, Todd.
[48:34.6 - 48:36.6] Again, we support the top five hyperscalers,
[48:37.6 - 48:40.6] but not all the top five hyperscalers spend CapEx the same way.
[48:41.6 - 48:44.6] And there's a couple in particular that sometimes are leading
[48:45.6 - 48:46.6] with the more complex technologies
[48:47.6 - 48:49.6] and then the other hyperscalers sometimes follow.
[48:50.6 - 48:52.6] What we're really encouraged about is where we're seeing
[48:53.6 - 48:56.6] a lot of our new wins come in and our demand outlook
[48:57.6 - 48:59.6] is with some of the hyperscalers that are at the leading edge
[49:00.6 - 49:01.6] of the more complex technologies.
[49:02.0 - 49:04.0] Hence, we're seeing the demand strengthen AIML compute
[49:05.0 - 49:07.0] and we're seeing the wins come in on the 800G switches,
[49:08.0 - 49:09.0] some of which are starting to be shipped in 24
[49:10.0 - 49:12.0] and then a lot more which will be shipped in 2025.
[49:13.0 - 49:16.0] And as we see some of the other hyperscalers that follow behind that,
[49:17.0 - 49:20.0] it gives us an idea of the fact that this does have an opportunity
[49:21.0 - 49:24.0] to be a multi-year opportunity for us.
[49:25.0 - 49:28.0] And to Rob's point, we're really in the early stages right now
[49:29.0 - 49:30.0] of the AIML CapEx investment cycle.
[49:30.3 - 49:32.3] Of course, nobody has visibility 10 years out
[49:33.3 - 49:34.3] on what things are going to look like,
[49:35.3 - 49:37.3] but we are seeing demand signals at least for the next two or three years.
[49:38.3 - 49:42.3] And I would just close with the adoption of some custom silicon
[49:43.3 - 49:45.3] is going to drive compute programs
[49:46.3 - 49:47.3] and that's going to accelerate in the future.
[49:48.3 - 49:51.3] And then investment in AI is also going to drive advanced networking
[49:52.3 - 49:53.3] and that's going to be a driver in the future.
[49:54.3 - 49:56.3] And then also with our enterprise customers,
[49:56.6 - 49:58.6] we expect to see the internet traffic
[49:59.6 - 50:02.6] is going to drive improvements in data center interconnect as well.
[50:03.6 - 50:06.6] So this whole upgrade cycle, I think, has a long life to it.
[50:07.6 - 50:09.6] Appreciate the color. Thanks a lot.
[50:10.6 - 50:11.6] Thanks.
[50:12.6 - 50:13.6] Thank you.
[50:14.6 - 50:16.6] There are no further questions at this time.
[50:17.6 - 50:19.6] I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Rob Mayones
[50:20.6 - 50:21.6] for final closing comments.
[50:22.6 - 50:23.6] Thank you.
[50:23.9 - 50:26.9] I'm pleased that we posted another solid quarter
[50:27.9 - 50:28.9] and the momentum is carrying through
[50:29.9 - 50:31.9] into the first quarter of 2024 and all through 2024.
[50:32.9 - 50:34.9] I'm also pleased by our continued strong execution
[50:35.9 - 50:36.9] and encouraged with our strong market position
[50:37.9 - 50:38.9] and growing markets.
[50:39.9 - 50:40.9] Thank you again for joining today's call
[50:41.9 - 50:42.9] and I look forward to updating you next quarter.
[50:45.9 - 50:46.9] Thank you, sir.
[50:47.9 - 50:49.9] Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today.
[50:50.9 - 50:51.9] We thank you for participating
[50:52.2 - 50:54.2] and ask that you please disconnect your lines.
[50:55.2 - 50:56.2] Have a lovely day.
