[00:29.3 - 00:35.8] 2022. I would now like to turn the conference over to Craig Oberg. Please go
[00:35.8 - 00:41.6] ahead. Good morning and thank you for joining us on Celestica's third quarter
[00:41.6 - 00:46.3] 2022 earnings conference call. On the call today are Rob Maiones, President and

[03:10.9 - 03:15.0] measures from our financial statements. Unless otherwise specified all
[03:15.0 - 03:19.6] references to dollars on this call are to US dollars and per share information
[03:19.6 - 03:25.1] is based on diluted shares outstanding. Let me now turn the call over to Rob.
[03:25.1 - 03:29.6] Thank you Craig. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on today's
[03:29.6 - 03:35.3] conference call. In the third quarter Celestica achieved revenue of 1.92
[03:35.3 - 03:39.5] billion dollars above the high end of our guidance range on the back of strong
[03:39.5 - 03:43.9] demand across the majority of our businesses combined with solid execution
[03:43.9 - 03:48.8] by our team. Our ability to deliver on this demand in the face of continued
[03:48.8 - 03:55.0] macroeconomic challenges resulted in our highest ever non-IFRS operating margin
[03:55.0 - 04:02.5] of 5.1 percent and our quarterly non-IFRS adjusted EPS of 52 cents was our
[04:02.5 - 04:09.7] highest result in more than 20 years. Our strong third quarter results reflect
[04:09.8 - 04:15.2] Celestica's continued execution of a long-term strategic plan. Because of our
[04:15.2 - 04:19.2] strong performance and the momentum we are seeing continue into the fourth
[04:19.2 - 04:26.1] quarter we are pleased to raise our full year 2022 revenue and non-IFRS adjusted
[04:26.1 - 04:33.1] EPS guidance ranges. At the midpoint our revenue guidance of 7.16 billion dollars
[04:33.1 - 04:39.5] would represent an increase of 27 percent year-over-year if achieved. Also
[04:39.5 - 04:46.6] our non-IFRS adjusted EPS guidance of $1.86 at the midpoint would represent an
[04:46.6 - 04:53.0] increase of 43 percent year-over-year if achieved. The new Celestica marked by
[04:53.0 - 04:58.4] nearly 70 percent of our revenue concentrated in high value markets is
[04:58.4 - 05:02.9] providing us with the foundation to navigate through ongoing macroeconomic
[05:02.9 - 05:08.0] challenges. We continue to execute on the many growth opportunities we see in
[05:08.0 - 05:13.8] front of us supported by strong bookings, customer backlogs, and enabled by our
[05:13.8 - 05:20.6] diversified portfolio. On the back of a strong 2022 we are also taking this
[05:20.6 - 05:27.4] opportunity to provide a full year 2023 outlook. For the coming fiscal year we
[05:27.4 - 05:32.6] expect to achieve revenues of at least 7.5 billion dollars and our
[05:32.6 - 05:39.7] outlook for non-IFRS adjusted EPS is $1.95 to $2.05 which if
[05:39.7 - 05:45.6] achieved would mark another record high for our company. Additionally we are
[05:45.6 - 05:50.6] pleased to increase our company's target non-IFRS operating margin range by 50
[05:50.6 - 05:56.1] basis points to four and a half to five and a half percent. Before I provide
[05:56.1 - 06:00.5] further color on the outlook for each of our businesses I would like to turn the
[06:00.5 - 06:04.3] call over to Mandeep who will provide a detailed overview of our financial
[06:04.3 - 06:08.4] performance in the third quarter as well as our guidance for the fourth quarter.
[06:08.4 - 06:14.5] Thank you Rob and good morning everyone. Third quarter 2022 revenue came in at
[06:14.5 - 06:19.5] 1.92 billion dollars exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Revenue was
[06:19.5 - 06:24.5] up 31 percent year-over-year and up 12 percent sequentially fueled by double
[06:24.5 - 06:30.0] digit revenue growth across the majority of our businesses. We achieved non-IFRS
[06:30.0 - 06:34.6] operating margin of 5.1 percent 30 basis points higher than the midpoint of our
[06:34.6 - 06:39.7] guidance ranges driven by strong profitability in both our ATS and CCS
[06:39.7 - 06:46.1] segments. Non-IFRS operating margin was up 90 basis points year-over-year and up
[06:46.1 - 06:50.6] 30 basis points sequentially. This represents the first time Celestica has
[06:50.6 - 06:57.3] achieved non-IFRS operating margin above 5 percent. Non-IFRS adjusted earnings per
[06:57.3 - 07:02.1] share were 52 cents well above the high end of our guidance range and up 17
[07:02.1 - 07:07.9] cents year-over-year and up 8 cents sequentially. ATS segment revenue was up
[07:07.9 - 07:11.4] 30 percent year-over-year in the third quarter meaningfully higher than our
[07:11.4 - 07:16.2] expectations of a high teen percentage year-over-year increase. The year-over-year
[07:16.2 - 07:20.5] growth in ATS segment revenue was driven by the continued strong performance of
[07:20.5 - 07:26.3] our capital equipment industrial and AMD businesses supported by solid demand new
[07:26.3 - 07:32.1] program ramps and improved material availability. Sequentially ATS segment
[07:32.1 - 07:37.2] revenue was up 10 percent. ATS segment revenues accounted for 40 percent of
[07:37.2 - 07:43.0] total revenues in the third quarter. Our CCS segment delivered another quarter of
[07:43.0 - 07:47.4] strong growth with revenue up 32 percent year-over-year driven by strength in our
[07:47.4 - 07:51.5] communications and market primarily due to the strong performance in our HPS
[07:51.5 - 07:57.8] business. CCS segment revenue was 13 percent higher sequentially. Our HPS
[07:57.8 - 08:02.6] business continues to exhibit very strong growth delivering revenue of 517
[08:02.6 - 08:07.9] million dollars in the third quarter up 72 percent year-over-year. The growth in
[08:07.9 - 08:11.8] HPS was driven by strong demand from service providers as they continue to
[08:11.8 - 08:16.6] invest in data center expansion. We are pleased that our HPS business continues
[08:16.6 - 08:20.9] to gain market share helping us outpace anticipated underlying market growth
[08:20.9 - 08:26.6] rates. HPS revenue were 27 percent of total company revenues in the third
[08:26.6 - 08:32.1] quarter. Communications revenue was up 42 percent year-over-year ahead of our
[08:32.1 - 08:36.0] expectations of a mid-team percentage increase and was up 22 percent
[08:36.0 - 08:41.0] sequentially. As noted the year-over-year and sequential growth was driven by our
[08:41.0 - 08:46.6] HPS business and improved material availability. Enterprise revenue in the
[08:46.6 - 08:50.9] quarter was up 13 percent year-over-year close to our mid-team percentage
[08:50.9 - 08:55.5] expectations driven by increased customer demand and new program ramps.
[08:55.5 - 09:03.2] Sequentially enterprise revenue was 3 percent lower. Turning to segment margin.
[09:03.2 - 09:08.5] HPS segment margin was 5.0 percent in the third quarter up 70 basis points
[09:08.5 - 09:12.9] year-over-year and up 50 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year margin
[09:12.9 - 09:16.6] increase was driven by improved profitability across the segment as a
[09:16.6 - 09:23.6] result of stronger demand and maturing program ramps. TCS segment margin of 5.2
[09:23.6 - 09:29.2] percent the highest CCS segment margin ever reported was up 110 basis points
[09:29.2 - 09:34.1] year-over-year and up 20 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year margin
[09:34.1 - 09:39.9] increase was driven by volume leverage and improved mix within our HPS business.
[09:39.9 - 09:44.8] Moving on to some additional financial metrics. IFRS net earnings for the
[09:44.8 - 09:50.0] quarter were 46 million dollars or 37 cents per share compared to net earnings
[09:50.0 - 09:55.1] of 35 million dollars or 28 cents per share in the same quarter last year and
[09:55.1 - 10:01.7] net earnings of 36 million dollars or 29 cents per share last quarter. Adjusted
[10:01.7 - 10:07.0] gross margin was 8.9 percent up 10 basis points year-over-year and down 10 basis
[10:07.0 - 10:11.1] points sequentially. The year-over-year improvement was driven by the benefit of
[10:11.1 - 10:17.6] operating leverage due to higher volumes in both ATS and CCS. Non-IFRS
[10:17.6 - 10:21.6] operating earnings were 98 million dollars up 37 million dollars year-over-
[10:21.6 - 10:28.0] year and up 15.5 million dollars sequentially. Our non-IFRS adjusted
[10:28.0 - 10:32.7] effective tax rate for the third quarter was 21 percent 2 percent higher year-over-
[10:32.7 - 10:38.8] year and 1 percent lower sequentially. For the third quarter non-IFRS adjusted
[10:38.8 - 10:43.4] net earnings were 64 million dollars up 20 million dollars year-over-year and up
[10:43.4 - 10:49.0] 9 million dollars sequentially. Third quarter non-IFRS adjusted ROIC of
[10:49.0 - 10:53.7] 19.2 percent, the highest in over five years, was up 4 percent year-over-year
[10:53.7 - 10:59.7] and up 3 percent sequentially. During the third quarter our top 10 customers
[10:59.7 - 11:04.3] accounted for 67 percent of our total revenue compared to 68 percent in the
[11:04.3 - 11:09.6] second quarter and 66 percent in the third quarter of 2021. We had two
[11:09.6 - 11:13.5] customers that individually accounted for 10 percent or more of total revenue
[11:13.5 - 11:18.4] compared with one customer in both of the second quarter of 2022 and third
[11:18.4 - 11:23.2] quarter of 2021. Both customers individually comprising greater than 10
[11:23.2 - 11:27.6] percent of our revenues are in our CCS segment and in aggregate operate across
[11:27.6 - 11:31.4] 20 separate programs which is a testament to the breadth of our product
[11:31.4 - 11:37.3] offering. Moving on to working capital. Our inventory at the end of the third
[11:37.3 - 11:43.6] quarter was 2.3 billion dollars up 218 million dollars sequentially and up 920
[11:43.6 - 11:48.1] million dollars year-over-year. Higher inventory balances have been a focus
[11:48.1 - 11:51.8] within our industry in recent quarters driven by the persistent challenges in
[11:51.8 - 11:55.7] the supply chain environment. Celestica's higher inventory levels, the
[11:55.7 - 11:59.8] result of longer lead times and strong demand, which are partially mitigated by
[11:59.8 - 12:04.5] customer cash advances, have enabled us to grow at exceptional rates while
[12:04.5 - 12:10.1] generating strong non-IFRS adjusted ROIC. As the material environment
[12:10.1 - 12:16.6] improves we expect inventory balances to reduce over time. Cash cycle days were 63
[12:16.6 - 12:20.3] during the third quarter, nine days lower than the prior year period and the
[12:20.3 - 12:25.2] lowest since the third quarter of 2020. Our team continues to work diligently to
[12:25.2 - 12:28.5] manage our working capital balances including working closely with our
[12:28.5 - 12:33.7] customers and suppliers. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were
[12:33.7 - 12:38.6] 39 million dollars or approximately 2% of revenue. As we noted in our previous
[12:38.6 - 12:42.2] earnings call we expected capital expenditures to be higher during the
[12:42.2 - 12:46.7] second half of 2022 after having lower levels of capex investment during the
[12:46.7 - 12:50.9] first half of the year. The increased capital investment is primarily to
[12:50.9 - 12:55.0] support program growth in our lifecycle solutions business including expansions
[12:55.0 - 12:59.1] in our Southeast Asia and Mexico footprint to support a number of new
[12:59.1 - 13:04.3] program wins. Non-IFRS adjusted free cash flow was 7 million dollars in the
[13:04.3 - 13:09.5] third quarter compared to 27 million dollars in the prior year period and 43
[13:09.5 - 13:14.3] million dollars last quarter. As of September 30th non-IFRS adjusted free
[13:14.3 - 13:18.8] cash flow was 51 million dollars and our fiscal year outlook continues to be 75
[13:18.8 - 13:24.0] million dollars as we make strategic working capital investments in 2022.
[13:24.0 - 13:28.8] Moving on to some additional key metrics. Our cash balance at the end of
[13:28.8 - 13:33.9] the third quarter was 363 million dollars down 114 million dollars year
[13:33.9 - 13:38.1] over year and down 2 million dollars sequentially. Our cash balance in
[13:38.1 - 13:42.1] combination with approximately 600 million dollars of borrowing capacity
[13:42.1 - 13:46.5] under our revolver provide us with liquidity of approximately 1 billion
[13:46.5 - 13:51.4] dollars which we believe is sufficient to meet our anticipated business needs.
[13:51.4 - 13:57.1] We ended the quarter with gross debt of 647 million dollars down 4 million
[13:57.1 - 14:00.7] dollars from the previous quarter leaving us with a net debt position of
[14:00.7 - 14:07.1] 284 million dollars. Our third quarter gross debt to non-IFRS trailing 12 month
[14:07.1 - 14:13.7] adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 1.5 times down 0.2 turns sequentially and up
[14:13.7 - 14:20.9] 0.1 turns compared to the same quarter of last year. At September 30th 2022
[14:20.9 - 14:25.8] we were compliant with all financial covenants under our credit agreement.
[14:25.8 - 14:30.4] During the third quarter we repurchased approximately 500,000 shares for
[14:30.4 - 14:35.0] cancellation at a cost of approximately 5 million dollars. We ended the quarter
[14:35.0 - 14:40.0] with 122.6 million shares outstanding a reduction of approximately 2%
[14:40.0 - 14:45.8] from the prior year period. During the fourth quarter we intend to launch a new
[14:45.8 - 14:50.5] NCIB program subject to necessary approvals after our current program is
[14:50.5 - 14:56.2] set to expire in early December. Return of capital to shareholders remain the
[14:56.2 - 15:00.3] priority within our capital allocation strategies. We continue to aim to return
[15:00.3 - 15:06.0] 50% of our non-IFRS adjusted free cash flow to shareholders and reinvest 50%
[15:06.0 - 15:11.4] into the business over the long term. However as noted in previous earnings
[15:11.4 - 15:16.1] calls our short-term priority is to focus on reducing our net debt while
[15:16.1 - 15:21.7] remaining opportunistic with our share repurchases under our NCIB. We currently
[15:21.7 - 15:25.5] believe our share price is trading at a material discount when considering our
[15:25.5 - 15:29.9] strong operating performance and as such we have recently been active in the
[15:29.9 - 15:36.1] market. Now turning to our guidance for the fourth quarter of 2022. Our fourth
[15:36.1 - 15:41.5] quarter revenue is expected to be in the range of 1.875 billion to 2.025
[15:41.5 - 15:46.1] billion dollars. If the midpoint of this range is achieved revenue would be
[15:46.1 - 15:52.9] up 29% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. Fourth quarter non-IFRS
[15:52.9 - 15:57.9] adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of 49 cents to 55
[15:57.9 - 16:03.7] cents per share. If the midpoint of this range is achieved non-IFRS adjusted
[16:03.7 - 16:09.3] earnings per share would be up 18% year-over-year. If the midpoint of our
[16:09.3 - 16:14.3] revenue and non-IFRS adjusted EPS guidance ranges are achieved non-IFRS
[16:14.3 - 16:19.1] operating margin would be approximately 5.1% which would represent an increase of
[16:19.1 - 16:24.9] 20 basis points over the prior year period and flat sequentially. Non-IFRS
[16:24.9 - 16:28.2] adjusted SG&E expense for the fourth quarter is expected to be in the range
[16:28.2 - 16:34.6] of 64 to 66 million dollars. We anticipate our non-IFRS adjusted
[16:34.6 - 16:40.7] effective tax rate to be approximately 21% for the fourth quarter. Now turning
[16:40.7 - 16:45.3] to our end market outlook for the fourth quarter of 2022. In our ATS end
[16:45.3 - 16:49.4] market we anticipate revenue to be up in the mid 20 percentage range year-over-year
[16:49.4 - 16:55.1] driven by double-digit growth in all of our ATS businesses.
[16:53.4 - 16:58.5] In our CCS segment, we anticipate revenues in our communications end market to be up
[16:58.5 - 17:03.8] in the low 30s percentage range year-over-year, driven by new ramps and continued strong demand
[17:03.8 - 17:08.8] from service provider customers supported by our HPS offering.
[17:08.8 - 17:13.9] In our enterprise end market, we anticipate revenue growth in the mid-20s percentage range
[17:13.9 - 17:19.4] year-over-year, supported by new program ramps in storage and strong demand in compute.
[17:20.4 - 17:24.3] I'll now turn the call back over to Rob to provide additional color on our end market
[17:24.3 - 17:30.8] and overall business outlook. Thank you, Mandeep. Before I move on to our end market outlook,
[17:30.8 - 17:36.2] I want to take a step back and provide some commentary on the sustainability of our ongoing
[17:36.2 - 17:44.0] success, given the current macroeconomic backdrop. As we noted, our non-IFRS operating margin in the
[17:44.0 - 17:51.7] third quarter surpassed 5% for the first time in our company's history, as we recorded our 11th
[17:51.7 - 17:58.9] consecutive quarter of year-over-year non-IFRS operating margin improvement. We are also poised
[17:58.9 - 18:06.9] to achieve a new record high in non-IFRS adjusted EPS in 2022, and if the outlook we provided is
[18:06.9 - 18:15.2] achieved, surpass that mark in 2023. While Celestica is by no means immune to the impacts
[18:15.2 - 18:21.4] of cyclical changes in demand, we believe that we have made some important structural changes to our
[18:21.4 - 18:28.3] company, as well as key strategic decisions which have helped us evolve into a more diversified,
[18:28.3 - 18:35.7] resilient, and profitable business. 67% of our revenues are now coming from more diversified
[18:35.7 - 18:42.5] markets with higher barriers to entry, what we call a life cycle solutions business. As we
[18:42.5 - 18:48.4] continue to grow life cycle solutions, we expect benefits from both volume leverage and mix,
[18:49.0 - 18:56.0] providing additional support to our already strong margins. Moreover, our exposure to consumer
[18:56.0 - 19:02.1] markets is minimal, and our fixed cost structure is lean, and does not require significant
[19:02.1 - 19:08.1] investments. Therefore, we believe we will outgrow the broader market in 2023
[19:08.7 - 19:13.8] due to our end market exposure, new program wins, and market share gains.
[19:15.3 - 19:19.4] Now, I would like to turn to our outlook for our businesses.
[19:22.4 - 19:27.4] Starting with our ATS segment, our capital equipment business continues to exhibit strong
[19:27.4 - 19:34.5] growth driven by secular demand, new program ramps, and market share gains. We anticipate
[19:34.5 - 19:39.5] this change will continue through the fourth quarter as the short-term impacts of China
[19:39.5 - 19:47.5] export controls are mitigated by our existing backlog. The wafer fabrication equipment market
[19:47.5 - 19:53.9] has experienced significant growth over the past three years, and market estimates are calling for
[19:53.9 - 20:01.7] a moderation in spending in 2023. Our business, however, is primarily focused on pockets of the
[20:01.7 - 20:07.7] wafer fab equipment market where we anticipate demand remaining strong, such as investments in
[20:07.7 - 20:13.6] new capacity to support onshoring and our focus on leading-edge technologies of less than seven
[20:13.6 - 20:20.8] nanometers. Based on our strong order backlog, new wins, and market share gains, we expect to
[20:20.8 - 20:25.7] continue to outperform the broader wafer fab equipment market expectations in the coming
[20:25.7 - 20:32.3] quarter. New program ramps and robust demand in our industrial business continue to be supported
[20:32.3 - 20:38.4] by favorable long-term secular trends. Investment in green technologies, such as energy storage and
[20:38.4 - 20:44.7] generation, and growth in the electrical vehicle market supporting demand for EV charging projects
[20:44.7 - 20:50.7] are expected to sustain growth in demand for the next several years. Our industrial business has
[20:50.7 - 20:56.7] grown 18 percent organically in the first nine months of the year, and we expect these trends to
[20:56.7 - 21:04.7] support double-digit organic revenue growth into 2023. Now turning to A&D, we continue to see
[21:04.7 - 21:10.9] improvements in commercial aerospace highlighted by new program wins. Commercial aerospace demand
[21:10.9 - 21:16.4] driven by business jet and single-aisle aircrafts is projected to continue to strengthen through
[21:16.4 - 21:22.8] 2023. Market estimates now suggest that commercial air traffic should return to near
[21:22.8 - 21:28.9] pre-COVID levels in 2023, which we believe should support further demand for new deliveries.
[21:30.4 - 21:36.5] Our defense business is also anticipated to continue its solid growth track as governments
[21:36.5 - 21:42.8] continue to strengthen their militaries, particularly in the EU. In our health tech
[21:42.8 - 21:49.6] business, new project ramps in surgical devices and sports medicine are expected to drive sequential
[21:49.6 - 21:54.8] and year-over-year revenue growth. We are also seeing solid demand for imaging and patient
[21:54.8 - 22:02.0] monitoring devices and anticipate contribution from new projects beginning next year. Strong demand
[22:02.0 - 22:07.6] and new wins in imaging and patient monitoring are expected to more than offset an anticipated
[22:07.6 - 22:14.8] softening in COVID-related demand for diagnostic equipment. Now turning to our CCS segment,
[22:15.5 - 22:20.9] our HPS business remains the primary driver of the strong results in our CCS segment,
[22:20.9 - 22:27.1] recording $1.34 billion in revenue for the first nine months of the year,
[22:27.1 - 22:34.1] a 67% growth rate compared to that of the prior year period. The remarkable growth we are seeing
[22:34.1 - 22:40.0] in our HPS business is supported by significant capital investments from our service provider
[22:40.0 - 22:46.5] customers as they scale their data center capacity, coupled with our gains in market share from ODMs.
[22:47.7 - 22:53.6] As we have noted in prior calls, it is our view that this trend is likely to continue for at least
[22:53.6 - 23:00.9] the near term, though we expect growth rates will moderate into 2023 as comps become tougher with
[23:00.9 - 23:08.0] each subsequent quarter. New ramps and strong demand from existing programs continue to support
[23:08.0 - 23:13.2] growth in our communications end market with a significant portion of that demand strength
[23:13.2 - 23:20.0] coming from hyperscaler customers for our HPS offering. We anticipate demand to remain healthy
[23:20.0 - 23:28.4] into 2023 as we ramp new wins. And finally, in our enterprise end market, continued growth in
[23:28.4 - 23:34.1] storage demand is supported by new program ramps, which we anticipate will continue through the end
[23:34.1 - 23:39.8] of the year. Demand for compute is also expected to remain strong into the end of the year.
[23:40.4 - 23:45.5] Across enterprise, despite double-digit year-to-year growth during 2022,
[23:46.1 - 23:52.0] we remain cautious in our outlook as potential signs of slowing demand in the broader economy
[23:52.0 - 23:57.4] have typically had a more pronounced impact on demand from our enterprise customers.
[23:59.1 - 24:05.3] I am incredibly pleased with what Celestica has accomplished thus far in 2022. Despite a
[24:05.3 - 24:10.6] challenging environment, our team has done an admirable job of managing the factors within
[24:10.6 - 24:17.0] our control. This is reflected in our results this quarter and our strong outlook for the year ahead.
[24:17.6 - 24:24.4] We are confident that our focus on our strategic plan and consistent execution will drive value
[24:24.5 - 24:27.5] for our shareholders over the long term. With that,
[24:28.2 - 24:32.8] I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for questions. Thank you.
[24:35.9 - 24:41.1] Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question and answer session.
[24:42.0 - 24:46.7] If you would like to ask a question, please press star followed by the number one on your
[24:46.7 - 24:53.1] telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question, please press star followed by the
[24:53.1 - 25:01.8] number two. One moment, please, for your first question. Your first question comes from
[25:01.8 - 25:06.6] Sanis Mouskopoulos of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
[25:08.1 - 25:14.4] Hi, good morning. Rob, if we look at the upside in the quarter relative to your prior expectations,
[25:14.4 - 25:18.9] you said it was a combination of both stronger demand and better component availability.
[25:19.6 - 25:24.1] Just qualitatively, if we think about the relative weighting of those two factors,
[25:24.1 - 25:28.8] was it more weighted towards demand upside or more towards supply chain doing better than you thought?
[25:30.4 - 25:36.4] Hi, Sanis. I would say it was more along the lines of supply chain constraints improving.
[25:36.4 - 25:42.7] Our clear to build was better than original expectations, so it was enabling us to convert
[25:42.7 - 25:49.3] our backlog and fulfill our strong demand, if you will. Demand did really not moderate in the
[25:49.3 - 25:54.3] quarter, but our fill rates, our ability to convert it was actually better than anticipated.
[25:56.8 - 26:03.9] Now, as far as 2023, you're introducing fiscal 23 guidance before 22 is even over. Presumably,
[26:03.9 - 26:08.3] does that speak to the strong level of visibility in the backlog that you currently have?
[26:09.1 - 26:18.5] Correct. As we look forward to 2023, we continue to see strong growth coming from many of our
[26:18.5 - 26:25.2] verticals. We do see a little bit light demand in some areas, as in China and in our enterprise
[26:25.2 - 26:32.6] business. But net-net, we feel confident that we're able to provide good, I think,
[26:32.6 - 26:37.2] given the macroeconomic backup, good growth going into 2023.
[26:38.7 - 26:44.6] Great. Finally, for Mandeep, how should you think about cash flow and CapEx over the next year?
[26:45.2 - 26:48.8] We did see a bit of a reduction in inventories. Sounds like you think that might continue.
[26:49.6 - 26:52.2] So presumably, that should drive some cash generation in 2023?
[26:53.2 - 26:57.2] Yeah. Good morning, Thanos. I would say that we're pleased with the cash generation we've
[26:57.2 - 27:01.6] had so far this year, but we always want to do more. Our outlook for this year is $75 million
[27:01.6 - 27:05.0] because we have decided to make a number of investments in working capital, as you've
[27:05.0 - 27:09.9] highlighted. As we go through 2023, we do anticipate that there is going to be improved
[27:09.9 - 27:15.9] clear-to-build on the materials side. That should help us unwind some of the working capital. And so
[27:15.9 - 27:22.8] our goal continues to be over $100 million, and we think that that's a safe floor for next year.
[27:25.1 - 27:27.2] Great. Thanks, guys. Congrats on the quarter, and I'll pass the line.
[27:28.0 - 27:28.8] Thanks, Thanos.
[27:32.4 - 27:37.6] Your next question comes from Rob Young of Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.
[27:38.7 - 27:42.7] Hi. Good morning. You already talked a little bit about visibility on the semi-cap space,
[27:42.7 - 27:49.0] so I wanted to dig in a little deeper there. You highlighted your exposure to leading process node
[27:49.0 - 27:54.0] is probably a little safer, but I'm just curious if you could talk a little bit about the visibility
[27:54.1 - 27:58.1] over the next 12 months. How much of that is covered by ramps that are already in progress,
[27:58.1 - 28:03.4] or how much of that is business that's locked in? Maybe just give it a sense of the level
[28:03.4 - 28:11.4] of visibility there. Sure, Rob. So just to take a step back, in 2022, we're on track to grow much
[28:11.4 - 28:16.8] faster than the market. We should be growing north of about 20%. And to your comment, that's on the
[28:16.8 - 28:23.1] back of new program wins and expanding market share. We have a very competitive footprint,
[28:23.1 - 28:27.1] that being in North America, Malaysia, and Korea, and we also have some fantastic
[28:27.7 - 28:31.2] vertical integration capabilities. That's a large reason for our growth.
[28:32.4 - 28:38.4] As we look into 2023, the broad market is certainly seeing some headwinds. Some of the
[28:38.4 - 28:45.2] more pessimistic analysts are predicting as much as 15% to 20% decline in wafer fab equipment
[28:45.2 - 28:51.6] spending. On top of that, we've all seen the news on this China export controls that could have up
[28:51.6 - 28:58.1] to an 8% additional impact if that is not resolved. That all being said, we should fare
[28:58.1 - 29:04.7] fairly well relative to the market for a couple of reasons. The first reason is mix. From a
[29:06.7 - 29:11.8] mixed perspective, we are focused in on the high-end node, so that less than 7 nanometers
[29:11.8 - 29:16.9] is 80% of our business. Demand is more robust there. Exposure to China is typically limited.
[29:17.7 - 29:22.8] Second is we have less exposure to memory, and memory is kind of under pressure right now from
[29:22.8 - 29:28.2] a growth perspective. And lastly, a good portion of our growth is coming from our vertical integration
[29:28.2 - 29:32.2] capabilities supporting the aftermarket and using our mechanical capabilities.
[29:33.0 - 29:36.9] And the second reason we feel confident that we'll perform better than the market is really
[29:36.9 - 29:42.8] new program growth. A lot of those programs started to ramp this year and will extend into
[29:42.8 - 29:49.7] next year. So net-net, we feel pretty confident that we'll perform better than the market,
[29:49.7 - 29:58.0] and we should be flat to up as we go into 2023. Okay. Thanks for all that color.
[29:58.0 - 30:05.1] And the margin guidance is very impressive. If I think back to past comments, I think that you've
[30:05.1 - 30:11.6] said that in order to get above 5%, it would require recovery in commercial aerospace. I was
[30:11.6 - 30:20.7] wondering, does the guidance for 2023 anticipate that business becoming a contributor to operating
[30:20.7 - 30:25.6] margins? Or maybe you could just give us an update on where the margin contribution for
[30:25.6 - 30:32.7] AMD is and where it's likely to go over the next year. Yeah. Good morning, Rob. So we're pleased
[30:32.7 - 30:37.2] with the trajectory that the company is seeing right now from a margin perspective. And some
[30:37.2 - 30:41.6] of the things that we highlighted, 5.1% this quarter, and that's our guide for Q4, highest
[30:41.6 - 30:47.2] margin in the company's history. If you take the midpoint of the Q4 guidance, it implies 4.9% for
[30:47.2 - 30:51.6] this year. That's the highest in the company's history. And then what we're doing now is we're
[30:51.6 - 30:58.2] raising the range for next year by 50 basis points to between 4.5% and 5.5%. Really, there's two main
[30:58.2 - 31:03.5] things that are driving that. Number one is continuing benefits from mix. So as lifecycle
[31:03.5 - 31:07.7] solutions revenue, which is two-thirds of the company's revenue, continues to grow and the
[31:07.7 - 31:13.2] margin profile for lifecycle solutions combined is accretive to the company, you will see benefits
[31:13.2 - 31:17.4] from a mixed perspective. The second is we are starting to see the benefits of volume leverage.
[31:18.1 - 31:22.8] While we were going through the transformation over a number of years ago, we made the strategic
[31:22.8 - 31:28.8] decision to maintain our investments functionally in the factories. We didn't take cuts everywhere
[31:28.8 - 31:34.9] that maybe we could have been asked to do so because we knew that we could maintain that
[31:34.9 - 31:38.8] structure when we were growing. And so our SG&A right now is not growing nearly as fast as the
[31:38.8 - 31:43.8] top line, so we're seeing volume benefits there as well. To your point specifically on A and D,
[31:43.8 - 31:48.0] so there's some puts and takes within the markets themselves. CCS, as you can see,
[31:48.0 - 31:52.5] is performing incredibly well. There are some mixed benefits happening right now,
[31:52.5 - 31:57.1] which will probably moderate, but we expect that CCS margins will still be strong going into next
[31:57.1 - 32:04.3] year. And then ATS, ATS coming back at 5%. So we're pleased with the margin profile in a couple
[32:04.3 - 32:08.4] of the businesses. Capital Equipment is performing very well. Health Tech is performing very well.
[32:08.4 - 32:13.6] But A and D's demand is still not where it was pre-COVID. And we are seeing improving profitability
[32:13.6 - 32:19.4] sequentially, but it's still more opportunity to be had in A and D as volume comes back.
[32:19.4 - 32:23.4] We're seeing the same thing in industrial. A significant part of our top line growth is coming
[32:23.4 - 32:29.6] from industrial, but those programs aren't yet at full profitability. And then lastly, as you know
[32:29.6 - 32:34.6] from last quarter, the PCI business, which is an excellent business for us and is a profitable
[32:34.6 - 32:40.8] business still, despite the fire that they had, is not operating at their peak levels either.
[32:40.8 - 32:46.0] So there's still some tailwinds, if you will, within ATS to help improve margins as we go into
[32:46.0 - 32:51.6] next year. Great. And that's beyond the four and a half, four and a half to five and a half percent
[32:51.6 - 32:56.4] operating margins? No, we've taken all of that into account. So while CCS may moderate a little
[32:56.4 - 33:02.7] bit going into next year, ATS has an opportunity to probably pick up any moderation. And then again,
[33:02.7 - 33:06.3] as we grow over our lifecycle solutions, it'll help us hopefully get to the higher end of that
[33:06.3 - 33:11.5] range as we go through next year. And just the last little one, the midpoint of EPS
[33:12.2 - 33:17.6] guidance is below that double digit long-term guidance you gave last year. I wasn't able to
[33:17.6 - 33:22.4] find that reiterated anywhere. Is that still the expectation? And I'll pass the line.
[33:23.2 - 33:27.9] Yeah. I mean, so what we're very pleased with is, as you know, the EPS growth that we're showing
[33:27.9 - 33:33.6] this year, the midpoint of the Q4 guidance calls for $1.86. The highest EPS that we had as a
[33:33.6 - 33:43.0] company, I believe, is $1.44 back in 2000. So significant increase in overall EPS. Now that's
[33:43.0 - 33:47.2] up 43 percent, I think, on a year-over-year basis. When you look at the dollar...
[33:46.8 - 33:53.7] $1.95 to $2.05 next year, the $1.95 implies 5% and the $2.05 implies 10%.
[33:53.7 - 33:56.8] And so we are, of course, working towards the higher end of the range.
[33:56.8 - 34:01.4] We do believe that 10% EPS growth is still the right number over the medium to long term.
[34:01.4 - 34:04.0] There will be some years, obviously, that are going to be a bit higher and there's some
[34:04.0 - 34:08.8] years that will be a bit lower, but we are targeting 5% to 10% right now, given the visibility
[34:08.8 - 34:09.8] we have today.
[34:09.8 - 34:10.8] Okay, thanks.
[34:10.8 - 34:11.8] Congrats on the quarter.
[34:11.8 - 34:12.3] You're welcome.
[34:17.4 - 34:23.4] Your next question comes from Ruplu Bhattacharya of Bank of America.
[34:23.4 - 34:24.4] Please go ahead.
[34:24.4 - 34:29.6] Thank you for taking my questions and congrats on the strong results in the quarter.
[34:29.6 - 34:32.1] My first question is on margins.
[34:32.1 - 34:37.6] You're guiding a 23 operating margin to 4.5% to 5.5%.
[34:37.6 - 34:42.6] What needs to happen for you to get to the top end of the range versus the midpoint versus
[34:42.6 - 34:43.6] the low end?
[34:43.8 - 34:50.4] And specifically, you said that the CCS segment, obviously, has been performing much above
[34:50.4 - 34:51.8] the long-term range.
[34:51.8 - 34:55.6] So how should we think about margins in that segment in fiscal 2023?
[34:59.6 - 35:05.1] The margins of 4.5% to 5%, I would say, is also tied to how the revenue profile is going
[35:05.1 - 35:06.1] to turn out.
[35:06.1 - 35:08.5] We set, again, at least $7.5 billion.
[35:08.5 - 35:13.1] If we come in just at $7.5 billion, we won't be at the higher end of that range.
[35:13.7 - 35:16.5] We would be somewhere between probably around 5%.
[35:16.5 - 35:20.8] But as we continue to grow revenue because of the strong backlog that we already have,
[35:20.8 - 35:24.6] we do expect to see some additional volume leverage, which will help us get to the higher
[35:24.6 - 35:26.0] end of that range.
[35:26.0 - 35:30.8] When you look at the segment specifically, so again, since we started posting segment
[35:30.8 - 35:35.2] margins back from the beginning of 2018, what we just posted for CCS is the highest they've
[35:35.2 - 35:37.0] ever posted.
[35:37.0 - 35:41.9] We don't expect that CCS will necessarily be above 5% next year, but at the same time,
[35:41.9 - 35:46.0] we don't expect them to go back to historical rates because it's just a very different mix
[35:46.0 - 35:47.6] now with HPS.
[35:47.6 - 35:52.0] And on the ATS side, we do continue to have opportunities to grow that margin.
[35:52.0 - 35:55.7] It's at 5.0% this past quarter, but there are opportunities.
[35:55.7 - 35:57.3] We talked a little bit about A&D already.
[35:57.3 - 36:02.9] There continues to be a recovery, which gives us cost leverage because that's a heavy fixed-cost business.
[36:03.9 - 36:09.9] PCI is not where it was expected to be this quarter based on both revenue and margin.
[36:10.0 - 36:16.0] And as that production comes back on to full equipment and is being utilized by the end
[36:16.0 - 36:19.3] of the year, we do expect benefits in PCI as well.
[36:19.3 - 36:23.0] And then just overall, it's the maturity of the ramping programs that we have.
[36:23.0 - 36:28.4] So we are ramping a significant amount of business, specifically in our industrial business.
[36:28.4 - 36:32.9] And as those programs continue to mature, there is improved profitability that we would expect.
[36:33.9 - 36:36.8] Okay, thanks for all the details there.
[36:36.8 - 36:39.9] My next question is on revenue growth.
[36:40.8 - 36:47.6] What is the expected contribution from PCI to Fiscal 22 revenue growth?
[36:47.6 - 36:54.1] And you said HPS in the first nine months is contributing, or it was up 67% year-on-year.
[36:54.1 - 36:58.6] How should we think about the contribution from HPS in Fiscal 23?
[36:58.6 - 37:04.4] I think you're guiding 5% year-on-year growth at the midpoint of the Fiscal 23 revenue guidance.
[37:04.4 - 37:08.9] So how much of that would be from the HPS revenue growth?
[37:09.9 - 37:16.9] Yeah, so Rupal, we don't break out PCI specifically, but I will go back to some previous public
[37:16.9 - 37:17.9] remarks.
[37:17.9 - 37:20.1] When we bought the business, it was around a $300 million business.
[37:20.1 - 37:21.3] That business has been growing.
[37:21.3 - 37:24.4] We've been seeing good commercial synergies as well.
[37:24.4 - 37:29.6] There could be up to $100 million of additional revenue contribution next year from the PCI
[37:29.6 - 37:33.2] business relative to 2022.
[37:33.2 - 37:39.2] On HPS specifically, I mean, this is just outsized growth, 72% year-over-year in the
[37:39.2 - 37:42.1] third quarter, 67% on a year-to-date basis.
[37:42.1 - 37:43.6] Obviously, that is not sustainable.
[37:43.6 - 37:47.8] Based on the trajectory of where the business is going right now, that business may be up
[37:47.8 - 37:53.6] anywhere from $700 million to $800 million year-over-year for Fiscal Year 2022.
[37:53.6 - 37:58.9] As we go into next year, we're expecting that growth rates are now going to probably normalize,
[37:58.9 - 38:00.3] maybe back down to market rates.
[38:00.3 - 38:04.2] So there will be a moderation in overall growth within HPS.
[38:04.2 - 38:08.0] But we do expect that the margin profile will continue to be very strong and continue to
[38:08.0 - 38:09.0] be accretive to the company.
[38:09.0 - 38:10.0] Got it.
[38:10.0 - 38:16.1] And maybe for my last question, if I can ask you on the capital allocation priorities for
[38:16.1 - 38:23.9] Fiscal Year 2023, specifically as you look at uses of cash for M&A versus returning cash
[38:23.9 - 38:28.3] to shareholders, how do you prioritize that versus reducing that?
[38:28.3 - 38:29.3] Yes.
[38:29.3 - 38:32.9] So our number one priority right now is strong cash generation.
[38:32.9 - 38:35.2] We're very happy with the strength of the balance sheet.
[38:35.2 - 38:41.8] As you know, $1 billion in overall liquidity, only 1.5 times gross leverage overall.
[38:41.8 - 38:44.8] So we do have a healthy balance sheet.
[38:44.8 - 38:47.3] We're going to continue to invest in the business in areas like CapEx.
[38:47.3 - 38:52.0] You saw strong CapEx this quarter because we are directly investing in new program wins
[38:52.0 - 38:53.0] that we have.
[38:53.0 - 38:55.4] So we're pleased about that as well.
[38:55.4 - 38:58.8] But when you go beyond that strong free cash flow generation and continue to invest in
[38:58.8 - 39:03.3] the business, I would say in the immediate short term is to continue to reduce our net
[39:03.4 - 39:08.7] debt, likely by building up a little bit more of a cash balance that allows us to tap our
[39:08.7 - 39:12.6] credit lines a little bit less intra-quarter, reduces our interest expense.
[39:12.6 - 39:16.0] We're going to have the NCIB program open until December 5th, and then our intention
[39:16.0 - 39:19.6] as we mentioned is to open up a new one so we can always have one open.
[39:19.6 - 39:24.0] We will opportunistically buy shares when there is severe depression on the share price.
[39:24.0 - 39:28.2] As an example, we've already said we bought back $5 million of shares last quarter.
[39:28.2 - 39:33.0] I can tell you that we actually bought back $5 million of shares in October already because
[39:33.0 - 39:35.8] of the severely depressed share price.
[39:35.8 - 39:39.8] And with a price around where it is right now, there actually probably isn't a better
[39:39.8 - 39:40.8] use of cash.
[39:40.8 - 39:44.2] It's a good way to return value to shareholders.
[39:44.2 - 39:49.4] That being said, we continue to have a long-term view on growing the business strategically.
[39:49.4 - 39:55.9] And M&A, when it's the right M&A, either adding capabilities that we need to accelerate our
[39:55.9 - 40:00.6] strategic roadmaps or to give us the added capacity which we can find synergies with
[40:00.6 - 40:04.6] our existing customer base, we won't hesitate to invest.
[40:04.6 - 40:06.7] We have a robust M&A funnel.
[40:06.7 - 40:07.7] We're very disciplined.
[40:07.7 - 40:10.6] As you know, we're blue and we look at a lot of targets that we don't pull the trigger
[40:10.6 - 40:12.8] on the vast majority of them.
[40:12.8 - 40:16.2] But we do believe that with the balance sheet that we have, the cash outlook that we have
[40:16.2 - 40:22.0] going into next year, the healthy balance sheet that we can pivot whether it's on the
[40:22.0 - 40:24.3] share buyback front or on the M&A front.
[40:24.3 - 40:25.3] Got it.
[40:25.3 - 40:28.2] Thanks for all the details and congrats again on the quarter.
[40:28.2 - 40:29.8] Thanks, Rupul.
[40:31.6 - 40:37.2] Your next question comes from Jim Suva of Citigroup.
[40:37.2 - 40:39.5] Please go ahead.
[40:39.5 - 40:40.5] Thank you.
[40:40.5 - 40:45.3] And your outlook and your current growth trajectory is very impressive in margins.
[40:45.3 - 40:50.1] Just curious about the impact and how we should be thinking about CapEx and maybe working
[40:50.1 - 40:51.4] capital like inventory.
[40:51.4 - 40:56.1] You mentioned supply chains getting better as far as component availability, but I think
[40:56.1 - 41:00.9] your inventory went up, but I'm sure it has to do with growing the business.
[41:00.9 - 41:07.1] But can you help us know about CapEx and inventory, your expectations going forward a little bit?
[41:07.1 - 41:08.1] Yeah, absolutely.
[41:08.1 - 41:09.1] Good morning, Jim.
[41:09.1 - 41:14.9] So, you know, on the CapEx side, we have traditionally said that our target range is between 1.5%
[41:14.9 - 41:16.8] and 2% of revenue.
[41:16.8 - 41:21.3] In the first half of the year, we were quite light, frankly, around 1%.
[41:21.3 - 41:26.0] But now that we're seeing the world come back to normal, restrictions being lifted
[41:26.0 - 41:29.8] in various countries and on the back of a number of new wins, we are seeing a higher
[41:29.8 - 41:32.1] level of CapEx investment.
[41:32.1 - 41:35.6] In the third quarter, we did 2% of revenue.
[41:35.6 - 41:38.7] In the fourth quarter, we'll probably be again at around 2% or even slightly higher than
[41:38.7 - 41:39.7] that.
[41:39.7 - 41:44.1] But as you look into 2023, I think the 1.5% to 2% range continues to be the right range.
[41:44.1 - 41:48.1] We may operate at the higher end of that range, but we have a good track record of being very
[41:48.1 - 41:51.4] disciplined on the CapEx investments we make.
[41:51.4 - 42:00.3] Overall, I would say that the working capital opportunity is there for us in 2023.
[42:00.3 - 42:03.9] As we had talked about, when Clear2Build is starting to improve, meaning we're getting
[42:03.9 - 42:09.1] more materials in than maybe we would have in the past, it gives us an opportunity to
[42:09.1 - 42:10.5] build less inventory.
[42:10.5 - 42:14.8] As you talked about, probably the primary reason that inventory has been building is
[42:14.8 - 42:17.9] because we're growing revenue close to 30% year over year.
[42:18.0 - 42:21.4] With the revenue guidance that we're providing next year, getting back into the single digits,
[42:21.4 - 42:25.5] the level of inventory is just not required as much as before.
[42:25.5 - 42:28.4] And as material constraints continue to improve, it gives us an opportunity to start reducing
[42:28.4 - 42:29.4] inventory as well.
[42:29.4 - 42:35.2] And so, we do expect some working capital unwind in 2023, which should provide us with
[42:35.2 - 42:38.3] a good opportunity on free cash flow.
[42:38.3 - 42:42.7] Thank you and congratulations to you and your teams.
[42:42.7 - 42:46.6] Thanks, Jim.
[42:46.6 - 42:51.4] Our next question comes from Paul Treiber, RBC Capital Markets.
[42:51.4 - 42:52.4] Please go ahead.
[42:52.4 - 42:54.8] Thanks very much and good morning.
[42:54.8 - 43:01.7] I just had a couple of questions on your outlook for 2023, which is obviously quite a bit stronger
[43:01.7 - 43:04.9] than the street was expecting.
[43:04.9 - 43:11.2] In terms of the macroeconomic environment, to what degree are you factoring in a slowdown
[43:11.2 - 43:12.8] in the environment?
[43:12.8 - 43:18.2] Or maybe, in other words, what do you see as driving upside to your guidance if that
[43:18.2 - 43:19.2] would occur?
[43:19.2 - 43:22.9] And then conversely, what would lead to downside to your outlook?
[43:22.9 - 43:26.7] All right, Paul.
[43:26.7 - 43:33.7] We have a pretty in-depth planning process when we do our strategic plan, but more importantly,
[43:33.7 - 43:36.5] our annual operating plan.
[43:36.5 - 43:43.4] We do a bottoms-up interlock with all our sites and all our key customers.
[43:43.4 - 43:48.5] So, the guidance and the outlook we provided, we feel pretty good about it.
[43:48.5 - 43:54.9] To answer your questions directly, what would provide upside to the outlook?
[43:54.9 - 44:02.0] It would be continued strength in our HPS business, our data center expansion growth,
[44:02.0 - 44:06.1] a little higher than we anticipated.
[44:06.1 - 44:14.5] Perhaps not as much as a down cycle in wafer fab equipment spending as we currently anticipated.
[44:14.5 - 44:20.0] Faster recovery in our aerospace markets would also help give us a boost.
[44:20.0 - 44:27.6] And our industrial business is going through a number of ramps, and should those be able
[44:27.6 - 44:31.8] to ramp a little bit more quickly and market adoption for those products that we're ramping
[44:32.8 - 44:37.4] improve, that would also give us some more upside.
[44:37.4 - 44:42.6] On the downside pressure, I would say everything that I just mentioned, but obviously the inverse
[44:42.6 - 44:45.4] of it would put us at that pressure.
[44:45.4 - 44:54.1] But that being said, again, we have a pretty balanced view of 2023, and we've taken the
[44:54.1 - 44:59.3] pluses and the minuses, and we hope to be able to improve upon the numbers that we provided
[44:59.5 - 45:02.2] as the year gets long, just like we have done in 2022.
[45:04.1 - 45:06.2] That's helpful. A couple of follow-on questions.
[45:06.2 - 45:10.9] Just, you didn't mention supply chain as a variable for 23.
[45:10.9 - 45:13.3] It looks like things are improving here.
[45:14.1 - 45:20.4] Is your outlook for 23, in terms of supply chain, does the potential slowdown on the
[45:20.4 - 45:25.8] consumer side, does that become a net positive or a strong net positive for you in 23 in
[45:25.8 - 45:26.9] regards to supply chain?
[45:27.7 - 45:29.3] Yeah, it's a good point, Paul.
[45:29.3 - 45:30.3] I probably should have mentioned that.
[45:30.3 - 45:32.2] It is a net positive.
[45:32.2 - 45:37.0] We're assuming a gradual recovery, nothing instant, but a gradual recovery.
[45:37.7 - 45:40.8] Right now, our clear-to-builds have gotten better.
[45:40.8 - 45:43.4] The decommits from our suppliers are less frequent.
[45:44.1 - 45:49.2] That being said, lead times for semiconductors in specific are still long.
[45:49.2 - 45:51.4] We need them to get shorter.
[45:51.4 - 45:54.7] That would certainly improve things.
[45:54.9 - 46:00.9] There are still certain technologies and certain suppliers that will remain constrained, I
[46:00.9 - 46:07.7] think, all through 23, because on the older node technologies where a lot of the suppliers
[46:07.7 - 46:09.0] are not building capacity out there.
[46:09.7 - 46:15.7] We're assuming all gradual improvement in our outlook as we get into 2023, but nothing
[46:16.5 - 46:18.9] demonstrous in terms of major improvements.
[46:21.0 - 46:22.1] Thank you, Al-Paswan.
[46:22.1 - 46:23.7] Congrats on the quarter and the outlook.
[46:25.0 - 46:25.4] Thank you.
[46:28.9 - 46:33.3] Ladies and gentlemen, as a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please press
[46:33.3 - 46:34.2] star 1 now.
[46:41.6 - 46:45.9] Your next question comes from Daniel Chan of TD Securities.
[46:45.9 - 46:46.6] Please go ahead.
[46:47.3 - 46:47.6] Hi.
[46:47.6 - 46:48.5] Good morning, guys.
[46:48.5 - 46:51.8] So you mentioned that the component supplies are helping with performance.
[46:52.6 - 46:57.2] Does improving component supplies have an impact on your margins, or is it neutral,
[46:57.2 - 46:59.8] given your ability to pass those costs through to your customers?
[47:02.5 - 47:08.3] To some extent, improved component supply improves the efficiency of our factories,
[47:09.7 - 47:11.9] so it does help our margins.
[47:11.9 - 47:21.2] In terms of pricing, through this cycle of price increases, for the overwhelming
[47:21.3 - 47:26.2] majority, we've been passing on those price increases in terms of forward pricing to our
[47:26.2 - 47:26.7] customers.
[47:26.7 - 47:30.2] So we'll rise and contract with the tide on that.
[47:32.1 - 47:32.4] Okay.
[47:32.4 - 47:33.3] Thanks for that.
[47:33.3 - 47:39.3] And to what extent is there a risk that your customers ordered more than they needed during
[47:39.3 - 47:41.7] supply issues, much like we saw in the retail sector?
[47:42.4 - 47:46.1] And with component supplies normalizing and you working through the backlog, that there'll
[47:46.1 - 47:48.5] be excess inventory in the channel in the near future?
[47:48.7 - 47:49.2] Yeah.
[47:49.2 - 47:50.0] Good morning, Dan.
[47:50.5 - 47:52.0] It's always a risk.
[47:52.0 - 47:56.1] Anytime you have a constrained environment where customers are going to start wanting
[47:56.1 - 48:00.2] to hoard product, I would say that that is always something that's out there, but it
[48:00.2 - 48:03.4] is something that we believe has been manageable overall.
[48:04.0 - 48:08.4] One of the things that, as you know, is we've been building a lot of deposits from our customers
[48:08.4 - 48:09.7] in order to build inventory.
[48:09.7 - 48:12.1] We have almost $600 million on the balance sheet.
[48:12.1 - 48:17.3] And so when we are being asked by customers to build inventory relative to what we're
[48:17.4 - 48:22.3] building inventory relative to a forecast that's there, often they're putting their
[48:22.3 - 48:25.9] money down to confirm that the demand is real.
[48:26.9 - 48:30.0] The other thing, and I know you know this about our business, the vast majority of the
[48:30.0 - 48:34.7] working capital that we have, our inventory specifically, is the liability of the customer.
[48:34.7 - 48:38.5] And so we are doing orders relative to a forecast.
[48:39.0 - 48:43.6] But customers also know that if they overorder or provide a forecast that doesn't really
[48:43.6 - 48:46.7] materialize, that that inventory is going to get pushed back to them and it's going
[48:46.7 - 48:48.1] to become their liability.
[48:48.1 - 48:51.7] So I'd say that there's a rationality right now in the overall marketplace.
[48:51.7 - 48:56.6] We are mindful of pockets of maybe buffering that's been happening, but we don't expect
[48:56.6 - 48:58.1] right now that it's going to be overly material.
[48:59.0 - 49:06.5] And I would also add, Dan, today we've either seen demand tempering or growth, demand
[49:06.5 - 49:11.4] decreasing or growth tempering, but we haven't seen customers cancel or push things out.
[49:11.4 - 49:17.0] Customers have been asking us to fulfill the backlog and maybe reducing the outlook
[49:17.0 - 49:19.9] a little bit, whether it's lower growth or lower demand.
[49:21.2 - 49:25.1] But we've been converting our backlog, so it hasn't been a material issue to date.
[49:27.2 - 49:27.5] Great.
[49:27.5 - 49:28.0] Thank you.
[49:30.0 - 49:30.5] Thanks, Dan.
[49:33.1 - 49:35.3] There are no further questions on the phone lines.
[49:35.3 - 49:39.9] I would now like to turn the conference back to Rob Mijones for closing remarks.
[49:40.1 - 49:40.9] Thank you.
[49:40.9 - 49:44.5] You know, we continued our strong start to the year by posting another solid quarter
[49:44.5 - 49:49.0] of results, and we continue to execute well through a difficult supply chain and macro
[49:49.0 - 49:50.1] environment.
[49:50.1 - 49:54.2] I'm pleased that we're able to raise our financial outlook for the full year and feel
[49:54.2 - 49:57.7] confident in our customers' demand and profile in order to do so.
[49:58.4 - 50:04.0] And given the current macroeconomic backdrop, I'm also pleased we're able to provide our
[50:04.0 - 50:09.2] initial outlook for 2023, and we will continue to work to diligently raise our projections
[50:09.5 - 50:10.9] as we progress throughout the year.
[50:11.4 - 50:16.1] Lastly, we are well-skilled at managing our business through economic cycles and feel
[50:16.1 - 50:20.7] confident in our ability to continue to navigate through any potential choppy waters ahead.
[50:21.5 - 50:25.3] Thank you all for joining today's call, and I look forward to updating you as we progress
[50:25.3 - 50:26.1] throughout the year.
[50:29.1 - 50:33.3] Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for this morning.
[50:33.3 - 50:35.7] We would like to thank you all for participating.
[50:35.7 - 50:38.0] You may now disconnect your lines.
[50:39.2 - 50:40.1] Thank you.
