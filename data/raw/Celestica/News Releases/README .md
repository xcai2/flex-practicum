## Analysis Summary

**Total Articles Identified**: 7  
**Successfully Extracted**: 3 (43%)  
**Blocked by Bot Detection**: 4 (57%)

**Coverage Assessment**:
- ✅ Official company announcement (SD6300 launch)
- ✅ Competitive landscape analysis
- ✅ Valuation and market sentiment
- ⚠️ Missing: Deep-dive strategic analysis from Seeking Alpha articles
- ⚠️ Missing: Technical stock analysis from Investors.com

**Recommendation**: The three successfully extracted articles provide a solid foundation for understanding Celestica's AI/data center strategy, competitive positioning, and market perception. The blocked articles would add additional depth but are not critical for the core analysis. Focus on cross-referencing the extracted information with primary sources (earnings calls, SEC filings) to build a comprehensive picture.
