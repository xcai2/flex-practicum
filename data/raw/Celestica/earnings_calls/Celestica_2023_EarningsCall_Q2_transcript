### Rob Mionis - President and Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, Craig. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call. We are very pleased to have delivered solid financial results in the second quarter. 

**Q2 2023 Performance Highlights:**

- **Revenue:** $1.94 billion, exceeding the high end of our guidance range
- **Non-IFRS Adjusted EPS:** $0.55, exceeding the high end of our guidance range
- **Non-IFRS Operating Margin:** 5.5%, the highest in the company's history
- Non-IFRS operating margin has been firmly above 5% for the past four consecutive quarters, reflecting the new Celestica
- **Non-IFRS Adjusted Free Cash Flow:** $67 million, our highest quarterly result in over three years

The strength of our results reflect the benefits of our portfolio's strategic diversification and our exposure to a number of very attractive markets. In our CCS segment, we continue to see solid growth in our hyperscaler business as we believe their investments in artificial intelligence and machine learning will provide long-term secular tailwinds in a number of our served markets.

In our ATS segment, ramping of new green energy programs coupled with returning commercial aerospace demand have continued to support double-digit year-over-year growth. We continue to execute well for our customers and our focus on operational excellence has enabled our growth and margin performance. Additionally, the material supply environment continues to gradually normalize, allowing us to further improve operational efficiencies.

Before I provide an update on the outlook for each of our end markets, I would like to turn the call over to Mandeep, who will discuss our financial performance in the second quarter and our guidance for the third quarter of 2023. Mandeep, over to you.

### Mandeep Chawla - Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. 

**Q2 2023 Financial Details:**

**Revenue:** Second quarter revenue came in at $1.94 billion exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Revenue was 13% higher year-over-year, supported by over 20% growth in our ATS segment and higher revenues in our CCS segment. 

**Margins:**
- **Non-IFRS Operating Margin:** 5.5%, up 70 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by improved volume leverage in both segments including strong profitability in our CCS segment
- **Adjusted Gross Margin:** 9.7%, up 70 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to volume leverage and cost productivity improvements

**Earnings:** Non-IFRS adjusted earnings per share were $0.55 for the second quarter, exceeding the high end of our guidance range, and were $0.11 higher year-over-year driven by higher operating profit and lower shares outstanding.

**Segment Performance:**

**ATS Segment:**
- Revenue: $865 million, up 24% year-over-year and higher than our expectations of a mid-teens percentage increase
- The year-over-year increase was driven by continuing strength in our industrial business supported by returning commercial aerospace demand in A&D, which more than offset demand softness in our capital equipment business
- Accounted for 45% of total revenues in the second quarter
- **Segment Margin:** 4.8%, up 30 basis points year-over-year, driven by greater volume leverage as our industrial green energy programs continue to ramp and commercial aerospace recovery as well as strong productivity

**CCS Segment:**
- Revenue: $1.07 billion, up 5% compared to the prior year period
- The increase was driven by very strong revenue growth in our enterprise end market, supported by strong demand for proprietary compute driven by AI and machine learning applications, and was partially offset by anticipated softness in communications demand
- **Segment Margin:** 6.0%, up 100 basis points year-over-year and the highest on record. The increase was driven by higher volume leverage, particularly in our enterprise end market as well as strong productivity and favorable mix

**End Market Performance:**

**HPS Business:**
- Revenue: $354 million in the quarter, lower by 23% year-over-year
- HPS revenues have moderated compared to the prior year period, driven by tough comps and anticipated shifts in hyperscaler CapEx spend from networking products towards compute capacity in support of AI applications
- HPS revenues were 18% of total company revenues in the second quarter compared to 27% in the prior year period
- We do expect HPS revenues to grow sequentially in the coming quarters

**Communications End Market:**
- Revenue lower by 15% year-over-year, in line with our expectation of a mid-teens percentage decrease
- The decline was driven by tough comps and reduced HPS networking purchases from hyperscaler customers, although we support these customers with other Celestica solutions

**Enterprise End Market:**
- Revenue up 42% year-over-year, well above our expectation of a high 20%s increase driven by the strong demand for proprietary compute

**Additional Financial Metrics:**

**Earnings:** IFRS net earnings for the quarter were $56 million or $0.46 per share compared to net earnings of $36 million or $0.29 per share in the prior year period.

**Tax Rate:** Our second quarter non-IFRS adjusted effective tax rate was 21% compared to 22% in the prior year period.

**ROIC:** Non-IFRS adjusted ROIC for the second quarter was 20.0%, an improvement of 3.8% compared to the prior year quarter.

**Working Capital:**

- **Inventory:** $2.3 billion at the end of the second quarter, down $58 million sequentially and up $238 million year-over-year
- **Cash Deposits:** $810 million at the end of the second quarter, nearly flat sequentially and higher by $284 million compared to the prior year period
- **Cash Cycle Days:** 73 during the second quarter, two days lower sequentially and four days higher than the prior year period

**Capital Expenditures and Cash Flow:**

- **Q2 CapEx:** $32 million or approximately 1.7% of revenue compared with 1.3% in the second quarter of 2022
- The increase in our capital expenditures aligns with our previously communicated expectations for increased investments in support of new program wins
- **Non-IFRS Adjusted Free Cash Flow:** $67 million in the second quarter, compared to $43 million in the prior year period
- Given our solid year-to-date performance, we are now expecting $125 million in non-IFRS adjusted free cash flow for 2023

**Balance Sheet:**

- **Cash Balance:** $361 million at the end of the second quarter, down $5 million year-over-year and up $42 million sequentially
- Our cash balance in combination with approximately $600 million of borrowing capacity under our revolver, provide us with liquidity of approximately $1 billion, which we believe is sufficient to meet our anticipated business needs
- **Gross Debt:** $618 million, down $5 million from the previous quarter, leaving us with a net debt position of $257 million
- **Leverage Ratio:** 1.2 turns gross debt to non-IFRS trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, down 0.1 turns sequentially and down 0.5 turns compared to the same quarter of last year

At June 30, 2023, we were compliant with all financial covenants under our credit agreement. During the second quarter, we purchased approximately 1.4 million shares for cancellation at a cost of $15 million. We intend to continue to be opportunistic on share repurchases under our NCIB for the remainder of the year.

**Q3 2023 Guidance:**

Now turning to our guidance for the third quarter of 2023:
- **Revenue:** Expected to be in the range of $1.90 billion to $2.05 billion, which would represent an increase of 3% year-over-year if the midpoint of this range is achieved
- **Non-IFRS Adjusted EPS:** Expected to be in the range of $0.56 to $0.62 per share
- **Non-IFRS Operating Margin:** Would be 5.6% if the midpoint of our revenue and non-IFRS adjusted EPS guidance ranges are achieved, representing an increase of 50 basis points over the prior year period and a 10 basis points increase sequentially
- **Non-IFRS Adjusted SG&A Expense:** Expected to be in the range of $66 million to $68 million
- **Non-IFRS Adjusted Effective Tax Rate:** Approximately 19% for the third quarter, excluding any impact from taxable foreign exchange

**Q3 2023 End Market Outlook:**

**ATS End Market:**
- Revenue anticipated to be up in the low double-digit percentage range year-over-year
- Driven by continued growth in our industrial, HealthTech and A&D businesses, partially offset by continued market headwinds in capital equipment

**CCS Segment:**
- Revenues expected to be approximately flat year-over-year in the third quarter as lower communications revenues are anticipated to be mostly offset by higher enterprise revenues

**Communications End Market:**
- Revenue anticipated to be down in the high single digit percentage range year-over-year
- Driven by tough comps and lower anticipated demand from certain programs in networking, including in our HPS business
- We anticipate a meaningful improvement on a sequential basis, when compared to the second quarter

**Enterprise End Market:**
- Revenue anticipated to be up in the low double-digit percentage range year-over-year
- Driven by anticipated continuing demand strength in proprietary compute from our hyperscaler customers

I'll now turn the call back over to Rob to discuss the outlook for our end markets and business overall.

### Rob Mionis - President and Chief Executive Officer (Continued)

Thank you, Mandeep. 

**2023 Outlook Update:**

Following our strong financial performance in the second quarter, we are pleased to raise our annual outlook for 2023:
- **Revenue Outlook:** Now at least $7.85 billion, which if achieved, would represent growth of at least 8% and our highest revenue level since 2007
- **Non-IFRS Adjusted EPS:** Now raised to $2.25, which if achieved, would represent 18% growth compared to the prior year
- **Non-IFRS Operating Margin:** 5.5% for 2023, which would represent an increase of 60 basis points from 2022

**2024 Outlook:**

As we look forward to 2024, we expect revenue growth across each of our businesses supported by anticipated strong secular tailwinds and new program wins. We believe that this growth, with continuing margin strength, will lead to non-IFRS adjusted EPS growth of 10% or more in 2024 relative to our 2023 outlook.

**Business Segment Outlook:**

**ATS Segment:**

We continue to expect our ATS segment revenue to grow in the mid-teens percentage range in 2023 compared to 2022.

**Industrial Business:**
- Has been the most significant growth driver in our ATS segment so far in 2023 with revenues up more than 40% year-to-date compared to the prior year period
- We anticipate that the year-to-year growth experienced by our industrial business in the first half of the year will continue in the second half of the year
- Our long-term outlook is also very positive as we believe that a number of structural tailwinds support demand, particularly for green energy, EV charging, and on vehicle projects
- We believe our business is well positioned to continue to capitalize on this demand as we ramp a number of new program wins in the space

**Capital Equipment:**
- Our outlook remains muted, as the wafer fab equipment market continues to work through a reduction in demand
- We are encouraged that due to the scale and structural adjustments made to our capital equipment business in recent years, we expect it to remain profitable during this downturn and outperform the broader wafer fab equipment market, due to the benefits of our mix, market share gains and new program wins
- We anticipate our capital equipment business to return to growth in 2024 in line with the most current outlook for the wafer fab equipment market
- We're pleased to be ramping a number of new programs, including a new lithography customer

**Aerospace & Defense (A&D):**
- We're seeing a strong recovery in demand within commercial aerospace and the normalization of commercial air traffic is expected to continue
- We're seeing benefits from this trend across all sub-markets of our commercial aerospace business, including single and dual aisle aircraft and business aviation
- We are benefiting from a number of new defense program ramps in 2023
- The outlook for our overall A&D business remains positive

**HealthTech:**
- Experiencing solid double-digit year-to-year growth driven by new program ramps in the areas of surgical instruments and imaging devices
- Our outlook for our HealthTech business remains positive and stable with less anticipated volatility in demand relative to other markets

**CCS Segment:**

For 2023, CCS revenues are expected to be up in the mid-single-digits compared to 2022, with anticipated growth in enterprise expected to more than offset softness in communications. We anticipate the recent strength in segment margin to continue and remain accretive to our overall business throughout 2023.

**Enterprise End Market:**
- Experiencing very strong growth being the beneficiary of hyperscaler customers' demand for advanced computing capacity to support artificial intelligence and machine learning applications
- We anticipate the demand for proprietary compute will continue to support double-digit revenue growth rates in enterprise throughout 2023

**Communications End Market:**
- The 2023 outlook remains muted when compared to 2022, as a result of a moderation in customer demand and difficult comps

**HPS Business:**
- Continues to experience demand moderation compared to 2022
- We anticipate stronger sequential revenues in the second half of the year
- Our current outlook calls for our HPS business to resume year-to-year growth in 2024 as new programs ramp

**Hyperscaler Business:**

Our total portfolio of businesses within hyperscaler customers remain very healthy, as they are continuing to make significant investments in their AI and machine learning capacity and capabilities. We have been a key partner for our hyperscaler customers as they have worked to build out their data center infrastructure. 

Hyperscalers now represent approximately $2.5 billion of revenue over the past 12 months for Celestica, having grown at approximately a 50% CAGR since 2018.

Recent hyperscaler demand has skewed towards proprietary compute products. Moving forward, we anticipate hyperscalers' ongoing deployment of AI and machine learning infrastructure will accelerate their networking refresh cycle as they are expected to need more advanced networking infrastructure to support their investments in computing capacity.

As a result, we anticipate demand for our HPS products and services to increase in future periods. We are market leaders in the 400G switches and are pleased that we are continuing to win engagements in 800G switches, based on our continued investment in next gen applications. Our strategic offerings and unique capabilities in networking are expected to support revenue growth with our hyperscaler customers over the long-term.

I am pleased with our strong performance during the first half of 2023. As the latter half of the year takes shape, we look forward to continuing to execute on our long-term strategic vision, delivering on our targets and driving value for our shareholders. We remain encouraged by the prospects for our business in the months ahead and into 2024.

With that, I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for questions. Thank you.

## Q&A Session

### Question 1 - Rob Young (Canaccord)

**Question about proprietary compute business:**

Maybe just a little bit of information on the proprietary compute elements of the business. I think you had one 10% customer in CCS. I assume that's in proprietary compute, and maybe if you could give a little more color around how many customers are in this space, if it's one that's driving all of this or if it's multiple if you're an enterprise and hyperscaler or if it's just driven by the hyperscaler. Maybe just a little more color to broaden that out.

**Rob Mionis Response:**

Sure, Rob. Yes, in the areas of proprietary compute, we're supporting multiple hyperscaler customers and ramping these types of products. And across those customers, it's not just proprietary compute. We're actually doing a number of different engagements. That means, high hardware platform solutions, services, proprietary compute, and other high value EMS engagements. It's also to point out, I'll add Rob, that our top 10 concentration right now is 61% down 7% year-over-year.

**Follow-up question about AI deployment and network refresh cycle:**

And then in your deck accompanying the earnings, it suggests that there's an AI deployment which would accelerate the network refresh cycle for you. I assume that's a reference to the 400 gig switch in HPS. And so if you could give maybe a little more color around what exactly that means, why would there be a network refresh cycle driven by that and how do you participate there?

**Rob Mionis Response:**

Yes. There's a couple of interesting mega trends associated with a proliferation of AI and ML products. On the networking, AI is driving the requirement for more networking power. So these accelerators, such as GPUs and TPUs significantly increased the need for bandwidth and thus power usage by more than 20 times. So this is actually creating pull through demand for our core networking products where we have a commanding share.

The other important networking megatrend, I should say, is 400G to 800G migration. So this migration is going to enable higher speed network equipment over the next couple of years, and we anticipate broader adoption of 400G and also building of 800G volumes. Again, we're a market leader in 400G and we also have several new engagements on 800G based on our strong heritage on the 400G. So we expect those volumes to continue as AI and ML proliferate and create this pull through demand.

**Mandeep Chawla added:**

And Rob, just add that 400G to 800G migration, that's primarily HPS products, so when we talk about HPS resuming growth in forward periods. That is part of the driver.

**Follow-up question about HPS outlook and capacity:**

Great. And then that's my last question is related to the HPS outlook. I think you said last quarter that it was some of your large customers working down buffer inventory. And then now I understand maybe it's more driven by spend shift towards this proprietary compute. If you're looking forward into 2024, do you have the capacity to manage both of those businesses at the current level of demand when HPS demand returns, if I can make that assumption?

**Rob Mionis Response:**

Yes. We're actually expanding capacity in our Thailand facility to enable this growth. That capacity – we're already started the expansion, that capacity will come online in the second half of the year, but we do have capacity to do HPS products and also the proprietary compute products. These are highly automated lines, and our Thailand facility is our flagship facility and has continued to operate fantastically through the pandemic and now coming out of it, it's at peak efficiency.

**Follow-up about inventory timing:**

And if that buffer inventory that some of your customers are working through, if demand drives them to choose to build up inventory, again, or if they're inventory that feed the inventory faster, could that come back faster than 2024 and then I'll pass line.

**Rob Mionis Response:**

Yes. On the AI/ML products, if we're able to get some of the silicon a little faster, it's certainly the demand, the backlog is certainly there, we should be able to actually fulfill that demand. But right now, AI and ML products are being paced by material. Broadly speaking, aside from that, and also aside from aerospace and defense, the material environment is largely back to pre-COVID levels. That being said, lead times are still extended on several commodities.

### Question 2 - Thanos Moschopoulos (BMO)

**Question about capital deployment:**

Hi, good morning. Just given the acceleration in free cash flow, what are your current thoughts on the capital deployments as you think about buybacks versus deleveraging versus M&A?

**Mandeep Chawla Response:**

Yes. Hi, Thanos. Good morning to you. We're really pleased with the cash flow generation. As you know, we've generated now positive free cash flow for over four years, so 18 quarters, I think in a row now. We're pleased that we're able to raise our overall outlook. Our balance sheet is very healthy 1.2 times leverage. 

To specifically answer your question, we've been active on the buyback front, but we have been opportunistic, as you know. The share price of course has materially accelerated through the quarter, but we did some buybacks early in the quarter, and we were able to buyback about $15 million worth of shares at just over $11 a share, which is very good value.

We'll continue to be opportunistic, if we believe that our results are not being properly reflected in our share price. But other than that, I would think we would continue to build dry powder. We continue to have a very robust M&A funnel. We don't have a large ticket item that I would say is right in front of us, but we are focused on tuck-in acquisitions, which will help continue to expand our capabilities. And so we want to continue to maintain that optionality, but we're able to pivot pretty quickly based on what's happening in the market.

**Follow-up question about CCS margin sustainability:**

Okay. That's helpful. And then with respect to the CCS margin, you're at 6% this quarter. I guess you're expecting that to moderate a bit in Q3 given the guide. But how should we think about the sustainability of that margin? I mean, obviously, you're seeing a shift towards compute, which is higher margin. But at the same time, you've got HPS, which is even higher margin, which is moderating. So how should we think about the interplay of those two dynamics and where you think the CCS margin can go in the medium term?

**Mandeep Chawla Response:**

Yes. So I'll start and then I'll turn it over to Rob. I mean, we're really pleased with the CCS margin performance. It's the highest we've ever had. And it's really a function of a couple of things. One is the volume leverage that we're getting, particularly in the enterprise end market. Two is the mix. We are seeing a favorable mix with the HPS products. And then three is just the overall productivity improvements that we're making across the business.

As we look forward, we do expect the CCS margin to moderate a bit in Q3, primarily because we're expecting the HPS revenues to be down a bit sequentially. But as we look into Q4 and into 2024, we do expect the HPS business to resume growth. And so we would expect the CCS margin to continue to be strong and accretive to the overall business.

**Rob Mionis added:**

Yes. And I would just add to that, Thanos, that the investments that we're making in our Thailand facility, the expansion there, is really to support the growth that we're seeing in both the proprietary compute as well as the HPS business. And so we're very confident in our ability to continue to deliver strong margins in that segment.

---

### Question 3 - Todd Coupland (CIBC)

**Question about industrial business and green energy:**

Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to drill into the industrial business a bit more. You talked about 40% growth year-to-date. Can you give us a sense of how much of that is green energy versus the other parts of industrial? And then as you look into 2024, do you expect that growth rate to continue or moderate?

**Rob Mionis Response:**

Yes. So the industrial business, as we mentioned, is up over 40% year-to-date. The majority of that growth is coming from green energy. We're seeing very strong demand in EV charging infrastructure, on-vehicle electrification, and renewable energy. We're also seeing good growth in some of our other industrial end markets, but green energy is the primary driver.

As we look into 2024, we do expect that growth to continue. We have a number of new program wins that are ramping. We're also seeing continued strength in the secular trends that are driving demand in green energy. So we're very optimistic about the outlook for our industrial business.

**Follow-up question about capital equipment:**

Okay. And then on the capital equipment side, you talked about it being muted. Can you give us a sense of how much that business is down year-over-year? And then what gives you confidence that it will return to growth in 2024?

**Mandeep Chawla Response:**

Yes. So the capital equipment business is down in the high teens percentage range year-over-year. We're seeing the impact of the wafer fab equipment market downturn. But as Rob mentioned, we're outperforming the broader market due to our mix, market share gains, and new program wins.

What gives us confidence in the 2024 outlook is really two things. One is the most current outlook for the wafer fab equipment market, which is expecting to return to growth in 2024. And two is the new program wins that we have, including the new lithography customer that Rob mentioned. So we're very confident in our ability to return to growth in that business in 2024.

---

### Question 4 - Maxim Matushansky (RBC Capital Markets)

**Question about proprietary compute and custom silicon:**

Great. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on the proprietary compute discussion. Can you talk a bit about the competitive landscape there? Who are you competing against? And what are the key differentiators that are allowing you to win in that space?

**Rob Mionis Response:**

Yes. So in the proprietary compute space, we're competing against a number of different players, including other EMS providers as well as ODMs. What differentiates us is really our engineering capability, our ability to provide complete solutions, and our track record of execution.

We have a very strong heritage in high-complexity, high-mix manufacturing. We've been doing this for many years in our HPS business. And we're able to leverage that capability and apply it to proprietary compute. We also have very strong relationships with our hyperscaler customers, and we're able to work with them very early in the design cycle to help them optimize their solutions.

**Mandeep Chawla added:**

Yes, the need for AI is really going towards this custom silicon, which has higher power usage and has higher cooling requirements. So the folks that are able to actually produce these products at scale are the ones that are winning in that space. And that frankly describes us very well. We have a very strong heritage in engineering, a very strong heritage with all the HPS products that we've been producing, that support our ability to actually produce these types of very complex products at scale.

---

### Question 5 - Daniel Chan (TD Cowen)

**Question about enterprise guidance for Q3:**

Good morning. Just wanted to drill into the enterprise guide for next quarter. You're guiding for low-double digits next quarter. I'm guessing that implies about $400-ish million, which is down from our estimated $500 million. So just any color around that volatility expecting for the next quarter would be helpful.

**Mandeep Chawla Response:**

Yes. Hey, Dan, Mandeep here. Yes, it is going to be down a little bit. Some of that is there's some seasonality in there. Again, we're coming off of some very tough comps, but on a year-over-year basis, still strong double-digit growth. What I would, again, say is that the growth is going to be continuing beyond Q3 and some of it's gated on when the demand is coming in, some of it's gated by material availability. And then as Robert also mentioned, we have been investing as well in capacity. And so we do continue to see that business growing even as we come out of Q3.

**Follow-up question about pull-through demand from networking:**

Okay. That's helpful. And then Rob, you talked about some pull through demand from networking. As customers accelerate their AI investments, are they engaging on programs outside of traditional data center hardware? So for example, you brought up cooling a number of times, are they looking to different cooling solutions with you or anything outside of your typical networking, compute and storage solutions?

**Rob Mionis Response:**

Most of the solutions we provide them are completed products. So we're deploying our cooling solutions in our HPS designs. We're also deploying them in proprietary compute. So we tend not to do engineering as a service. We tend to provide complete solutions, but we're also growing our aftermarket services business with these providers, especially in the areas of iPad and things along those lines, which is going to be a huge growing business for us moving forward.
