## Market Context

### U.S. Computing Leadership

The United States ranks **number one in computing power** globally (TOP500 supercomputer list), making it the top market for high-performance computers. This leadership position drives demand for domestic HPC manufacturing to serve AI hyperscalers and government institutions.

**Market Drivers:**
- AI cluster buildouts by hyperscalers (AWS, Google, Microsoft, Meta, Oracle)
- Government AI and supercomputing initiatives
- National security and supply chain considerations
- Tariffs and global trade uncertainty
- Regulatory compliance requirements (ITAR, export controls)

### Liquid Cooling for AI

Liquid cooling has become essential for AI infrastructure due to the extreme power density of GPU-accelerated servers. Modern AI servers can consume 10-20 kW per rack (vs. 5-10 kW for traditional servers), making air cooling insufficient.

**Liquid Cooling Benefits:**
- Higher power density support (up to 100+ kW per rack)
- Better thermal performance for sustained GPU performance
- Energy efficiency (lower PUE - Power Usage Effectiveness)
- Quieter operation (fewer fans)
- Smaller data center footprint
